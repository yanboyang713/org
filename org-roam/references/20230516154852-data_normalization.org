Normalizing the data refers to scaling the data values to a much smaller range such as [-1, 1] or [0.0, 1.0]. There are different methods to normalize the data, as discussed below.

Consider that we have a numeric attribute A and we have n number of observed values for attribute A that are $V_{1}$, $V_{2}$, $V_{3}$, ... $V_{n}$.
