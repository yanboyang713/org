** Fetching and ranking a live mirror list
In order to start with a shortlist of up-to-date mirrors based in some countries and feed it to rankmirrors one can fetch the list from the Pacman Mirrorlist Generator. The command below pulls the up-to-date mirrors, it uncomments the servers in the list and then ranks them and outputs the 25 fastest.
#+begin_src bash
  curl -s "https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=US&protocol=https&use_mirror_status=on"| sed -e 's/^#Server/Server/' -e '/^#/d' | rankmirrors -n 25 -
