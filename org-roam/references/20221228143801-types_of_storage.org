#+title: Types of Storage
#+filetags:
* Major types of storage
** Block storage
Bootable and file (need OS to store metadata about folder structure), database, protocol: iSCSI and Fibre Channel

** File storage
Only file in hierarchical folder, for multiple devices/share, protocol: SMB, NFS

** Object storage
Flat structure, rich metadata support, protocol: HTTP

Intuitively, think about “block storage” as “disk”, “file storage” as file share, “object storage” cloud/HTTP-based storage

Example:
