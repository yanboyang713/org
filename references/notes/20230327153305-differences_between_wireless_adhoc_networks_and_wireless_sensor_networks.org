|-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The medium used in wireless ad-hoc networks is radio waves. | The medium used in wireless sensor networks is radio waves, infrared, and optical media.                          |
| Application independent network is used.                    | The application-dependent network is used.                                                                        |
| Hop-to-Hop routing takes place.                             | Query-based (data-centric routing) or location-based routing takes place.                                         |
| It is heterogeneous in type.                                | It is homogeneous in type.                                                                                        |
| The traffic pattern is point-to-point.                      | The traffic pattern is any-to-any, many-to-one, many-to-few, and one-to-many.                                     |
| Wireless router is used as an inter-connecting device.      | Application level gateway is used as an interconnecting device.                                                   |
| The data rate is high.                                      | The data rate is low.                                                                                             |
| Supports common services.                                   | Supports specific applications.                                                                                   |
| Traffic triggering depends on application needs.            | Triggered by sensing events.                                                                                      |
| IP address is used for addressing.                          | Local unique MAC address or spatial IP is used for addressing.                                                    |
| Network Type Peer-to-Peer                                   | Network type Hierarchical or Mesh                                                                                 |
| Nodes Can be any wireless device                            | Nodes Limited to sensor nodes                                                                                     |
| Communication Range Variable depends on node placement      | Communication Range Limited by the sensor nodeâ€™s transmission power                                               |
| Communication Range Standard network protocols (TCP/IP)     | Communication Range Customized protocols for efficient data transfer and low energy consumption                   |
| Data Type General data (voice, video, files, etc.)          | Data Type Sensor data (temperature, humidity, light, etc.)                                                        |
| Power Consumption Can be high due to constant communication | Power Consumption Designed to minimize energy consumption to extend network lifetime                              |
| Security Security protocols can be implemented              | Security Security protocols are critical as sensor data can be sensitive                                          |
| Applications General wireless communication                 | Applications  Environmental monitoring, industrial automation, home automation, etc.                              |
| Deployment Can be deployed in any environment               | Deployment Typically deployed in remote or hard-to-reach locations, such as forests, oceans, or industrial sites. |
