The paper *"PANIC: A High-Performance Programmable NIC for Multi-tenant Networks"* (OSDI 2020) introduces a novel programmable NIC design—PANIC—to address the limitations of current SmartNICs in multi-tenant data center environments.

---

* Summary*
*PANIC* is designed to support:
- *High throughput and low latency*
- *Flexible and dynamic offload chaining*
- *Support for heterogeneous offload engines* (hardware accelerators, embedded CPUs, FPGAs)
- *Multi-tenant isolation*
- *Offloads with variable or sub-line-rate performance*

---

* Key Components of PANIC
1. *RMT Pipeline*: Uses match-action tables (like in programmable switches) to determine offload chains per-packet.
2. *Central Scheduler*: Ensures fair scheduling, load balancing, and tenant isolation.
3. *Switching Fabric*: High-bandwidth interconnect (crossbar-based) for routing between offloads at line rate.
4. *Compute Units*: Encapsulated offloads, which can be:
   - Hardware accelerators (e.g., AES, SHA)
   - Embedded RISC-V cores for general-purpose tasks

---

* *Evaluation and Results*
- Prototyped on an *FPGA* using the *Alpha Data ADM-PCIE-9V3* SmartNIC
  - FPGA: *Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU3P-2*
- Demonstrated:
  - *100 Gbps throughput*
  - *Sub-microsecond scheduling latency (<0.8 μs)*
  - Better isolation and performance over pipeline-based NICs
- Example Offloads:
  - AES-256 encryption (HW: 38.4 Gbps vs CPU: 0.154 Gbps)
  - SHA1 authentication (HW: 113 Gbps vs CPU: 0.192 Gbps)
  - Neural Network inference (HW: 120 Gbps, 66 ns delay)

---

* Which SmartNICs are used?
- The PANIC design was *prototyped on the FPGA-based* [[id:9a93b4a7-38a1-490b-82c7-1e0c425229a8][Alpha Data ADM-PCIE-9V3]] SmartNIC, equipped with:
  - *Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGA (VU3P-2)*
- *No commercial ASIC SmartNIC* (like Mellanox BlueField or Netronome) was used.
- PANIC is intended for eventual *ASIC implementation*, and their design aligns with ASIC feasibility analysis (e.g., crossbar, PIFO, etc.).

---

* Why use Alpha Data ADM-PCIE-9V3?
- Offers *FPGA reconfigurability* for prototyping
- Allows integration of:
  - Custom RMT pipeline
  - Central scheduler
  - Compute units (both HW accelerators and [[id:e14319eb-b98e-459c-8509-9911e399665f][RISC-V]] cores)
