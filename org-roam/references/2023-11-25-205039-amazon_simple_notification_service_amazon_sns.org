#+title: Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and send notifications from the cloud.

Amazon SNS is used for building and integrating loosely-coupled, distributed applications.

SNS provides instantaneous, push-based delivery (no polling).

SNS concepts:
+ Topics – how you label and group different endpoints that you send messages to.
+ Subscriptions – the endpoints that a topic sends messages to.
+ Publishers – the person/alarm/event that gives SNS the message that needs to be sent.
