#+title: tmux

Tmux (terminal multiplexer) is a tool that allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single window. Here are some key features and benefits of using tmux:

1. Session Management: You can create, manage, and switch between multiple terminal sessions.
2. Persistence: Tmux sessions can be detached and reattached, which means you can start a session, detach it, and then reattach it later, even after logging out and back in.
3. Window and Pane Management: Within a tmux session, you can split the terminal window into multiple panes, either horizontally or vertically. Each pane can run different commands or processes.
4. Customization: Tmux is highly configurable, allowing you to customize key bindings, appearance, and behavior to suit your needs.
5. Scripting and Automation: You can use tmux scripts to automate complex workflows and session setups.
   
Here are a few basic tmux commands:
#+begin_src bash
tmux new -s mysession: Create a new tmux session named mysession.
tmux attach -t mysession: Attach to the existing tmux session named mysession.
tmux detach (Ctrl-b, d): Detach from the current session.
tmux ls: List all active tmux sessions.
tmux kill-session -t mysession: Kill the session named mysession.
#+end_src

Inside a tmux session:
+ Ctrl-b %: Split the current pane vertically.
+ Ctrl-b ": Split the current pane horizontally.
+ Ctrl-b o: Switch to the next pane.
+ Ctrl-b x: Close the current pane.

To install tmux on Proxmox, you can follow these steps. Proxmox is based on Debian, so the installation process is similar to installing software on any Debian-based system.

1. Update Package List: First, update the package list to ensure you have the latest information on the available packages.
#+begin_src bash
sudo apt update
#+end_src
2. Install tmux: Use the package manager to install tmux.
#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install tmux
#+end_src
3. Verify Installation: After installation, you can verify that tmux is installed by checking its version.
#+begin_src bash
tmux -V
#+end_src

This should display the version of tmux that was installed.
