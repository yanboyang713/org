#+title: control theory
* Control theory
Three core concepts: pre-control, control and pulse

For example, there is a walking robot from A to B. Robots have their own pre-control and control program for how to walk.

Pulse: I kicked the robot (I give the robot a impact)

Robot will try to recover back to its initial state (walk).
