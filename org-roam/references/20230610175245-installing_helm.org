[[id:fd2a4c2f-4d5f-43b8-aab8-69b1ae33870e][Helm]] runs as a command-line interface (CLI) and is typically installed on your notebook.

You have several options for installing Helm:

* Using the Binary Releases
   https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-the-binary-releases

[[https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases][Download the release]], including the binary.

* Through Package Managers
** [[id:3a6998a0-3977-47ad-9714-be03316f5464][Homebrew]] ([[id:3b83621b-b66a-42f4-bebb-b6dbb2b6e68f][macOS]])
Members of the Helm community have contributed a Helm formula build to Homebrew. This formula is generally up to date.
#+begin_src bash
brew install helm
#+end_src
(Note: There is also a formula for [[id:26c24b4d-a5b3-46fb-93b5-6e9f40e477a0][emacs-helm]], which is a different project.)

* Using [[https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-script][Script]]

Use an installer script:
#+begin_src bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get > get_helm.sh
#+end_src
