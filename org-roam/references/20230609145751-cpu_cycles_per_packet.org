#+title: CPU cycles per packet (CPP)
#+filetags: CPP

In order to measure the [[id:28ef09a7-d590-40a5-b61d-679b2789e23d][Central Processing Unit (CPU)]] cycles per packet (CPP) spent in each network stack component, we first use the Linux perf tool [37] to count the total CPU cycles consumed in a 60-second packet transmission ($Cycle_{total}$), which is repeated 5 times. We also use perf to trace the function calls and measure the percentage of the overall CPU cycles spent in the corresponding function ($Cycle_{percentage}$). With the total number of packets sent in a 60-second packet transmission ($N_{packet}$), we can calculate the CPP of a specific function call as follows:
$$CPP = \frac{Cycle_{total}}{N_{packet} \times Cycle_{percentage}}$$
