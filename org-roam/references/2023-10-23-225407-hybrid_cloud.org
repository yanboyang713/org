#+title: Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud.

The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure to extend, and grow, an organizationâ€™s infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to the internal system.
