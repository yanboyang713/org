CI doesn't guarantee that the application will work, because tests can be wrong, but it removes the need to run tests from developers on an automated system. This gives you the great benefit of being able to test all your upcoming changes together to detect conflicts between changes. Another advantage is that the CI system can pack your solution in a [[id:6795991e-6e79-40f8-a72c-28e23b3d10ef][Container]], so the only thing that you have to do is deliver the container to a production cloud. The deployment of containers is also simple to automate.
