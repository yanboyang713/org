#+title: Amazon DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

Dynamo DB features and benefits:
+ NoSQL type of database (non-relational).
+ Fast, highly available, and fully managed.
+ Used when data is fluid and can change.
+ Common use cases include social networks and web analytics.
  
Push button scaling means that you can scale the DB at any time without incurring downtime.

SSD based and uses limited indexing on attributes for performance.

DynamoDB is a Web service that uses HTTP over SSL (HTTPS) as a transport and JSON as a message serialization format.

Amazon DynamoDB stores three geographically distributed replicas of each table to enable high availability and data durability.

Data is synchronously replicated across 3 facilities (AZs) in a region.

Cross-region replication allows you to replicate across regions:
+ Amazon DynamoDB global tables provides a fully managed solution for deploying a multi-region, multi-master database.
+ When you create a global table, you specify the AWS regions where you want the table to be available.
+ DynamoDB performs all the necessary tasks to create identical tables in these regions and propagate ongoing data changes to all of them.
  
Provides low read and write latency.

Scale storage and throughput up or down as needed without code changes or downtime.

DynamoDB is schema-less.

DynamoDB can be used for storing session state.

Provides two read models.

Eventually consistent reads (Default):
+ The eventual consistency option maximizes your read throughput (best read performance).
+ An eventually consistent read might not reflect the results of a recently completed write.
+ Consistency across all copies reached within 1 second.
  
Strongly consistent reads:
+ A strongly consistent read returns a result that reflects all writes that received a successful response prior to the read (faster consistency).
  
Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement – from milliseconds to microseconds – even at millions of requests per second.

Charged based on:
+ Provisioned throughput (write).
+ Provisioned throughput (read).
+ Indexed data storage.
+ Data transfer – no charge for data transfer between DynamoDB and other AWS services within the same region, across regions is charged on both sides of the transfer.
+ Global tables – charged based on the resources associated with each replica of the table (replicated write capacity units, or rWCUs).
+ Reserved Capacity – option available for a one-time upfront fee and commitment to paying a minimum usage level at specific hourly rates for the duration of the term. Additional throughput is charged at standard rates.
  
On-demand capacity mode:
+ Charged for reads and writes
+ No need to specify how much capacity is required
+ Good for unpredictable workloads
 
Provisioned capacity mode:
+ Specify number of reads and writes per second
+ Can use Auto Scaling
+ Good for predictable workloads
+ Consistent traffic or gradual changes
