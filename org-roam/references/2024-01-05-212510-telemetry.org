#+title: Telemetry

Telemetry is the remote, automated process of collecting, transmitting, and analyzing data from various sources to monitor their performance, status, and environment.

* Core Purpose

Telemetry provides observability into cloud environments. It allows engineers and operators to:
+ Detect failures or anomalies quickly.
+ Understand system performance trends.
+ Optimize resource usage and costs.
+ Enhance security by detecting suspicious activity.

* Types of Telemetry Data
Cloud telemetry generally falls into three main categories:

+ Metrics: Numerical values collected at regular intervals.
Examples: CPU usage, request latency, memory utilization.

+ Logs: Event-based data that records discrete actions.
Examples: User login attempts, API calls, service errors.

+ Traces: Distributed request tracking across services.
Example: Following a request through multiple microservices in a cloud-native app.

* Tools and Ecosystem
Many cloud providers and third-party platforms support telemetry:
