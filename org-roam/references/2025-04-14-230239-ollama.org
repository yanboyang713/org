Ollama, a platform that makes local development with open-source [[id:ab03a99b-2c97-4664-a1e6-680a86721f3a][Large Language Models (LLMs)]] a breeze. With Ollama, everything you need to run an LLM—model weights and all of the config—is packaged into a single Modelfile. Think Docker for LLMs.

* Download Ollama to Get Started
As a first step, you should download Ollama to your machine. Ollama is supported on all major platforms: MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

To download Ollama, you can either visit the [[https://github.com/ollama/ollama][official GitHub]] repo and follow the download links from there. Or visit the [[https://ollama.com/][official website]] and download the installer if you are on a Mac or a Windows machine.

I’m on Linux: So if you’re a Linux user like me, you can run the following command to run the installer script or [[https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/linux.md#manual-install][Manual install]]:

WARNING: No NVIDIA/AMD GPU detected. Ollama will run in CPU-only mode.
#+end_src

The installation process typically takes a few minutes. During the installation process, any NVIDIA/AMD GPUs will be auto-detected. Make sure you have the drivers installed. The CPU-only mode works fine, too. But it may be much slower.

* Get the Model from ollama model library
Next, you can visit the [[https://ollama.com/library][model library]] to check the list of all model families currently supported. The default model downloaded is the one with the latest tag. On the page for each model, you can get more info such as the size and quantization used.

You can search through the list of tags to locate the model that you want to run. For each model family, there are typically foundational models of different sizes and instruction-tuned variants. I’m interested in running the [[id:17dc3f87-99c6-4d34-afe1-11eab6245216][google gemma3]] 4b model from the Gemma family of lightweight models from Google DeepMind.

You can run the model using the ollama run command to pull and start interacting with the model directly. However, you can also pull the model onto your machine first and then run it. This is very similar to how you work with Docker images.

For Gemma 3 4b, running the following pull command downloads the model onto your machine:
#+begin_src bash
 ollama pull gemma3:4b  
#+end_src
* Get the model from [[id:514b9437-59ad-471d-b0d6-6c118a4590e4][Hugging Face]]

** Write a Modelfile that references the local GGUF
Minimal Modelfile (good defaults for an 8 GB GPU)
Save below as Modelfile:
#+begin_src file
  # Gemma 3 4B IT (QAT Q4_0), local GGUF
  FROM /opt/models/gemma3-4b-it-q4_0/gemma-3-4b-it-q4_0.gguf

  # Minimal, explicit chat template for Gemma 3

  """
  # Context window – start conservative, raise later after checking VRAM
  PARAMETER num_ctx 4096

  # Put as many layers on GPU as possible for speed.
  # If VRAM gets tight after load, lower this (e.g., 60 → 40 → 30) and recreate.
  PARAMETER num_gpu 35

  # Sampling: steady/concise output; adjust to taste
  PARAMETER temperature 0.1
  PARAMETER top_p 0.95
  PARAMETER top_k 64

  # Optional system prompt
  SYSTEM You are a helpful, concise assistant.
#+end_src

*** How to tune PARAMETERs (what changes and why)
+ *num_ctx* – max tokens kept in the context window.
  - ↑ increases memory used by the KV cache and slows prefill.
  - For 8 GB: start at 4096, then try 6144/8192 only if you still have free VRAM.
+ *num_gpu* – how many layers get placed on the GPU.
  - ↑ = faster but more VRAM for weights; ↓ frees VRAM for KV.
  - Goal: after loading, keep ≥ 1–1.5 GiB free (watch with watch -n 0.5 nvidia-smi).
+ Sampling (temperature, top_p, top_k) – style/creativity vs. determinism.
  - Lower temperature (0.1–0.3) = more focused; raise if too terse.
+ Other useful ones (optional)
  - *repeat_penalty* (e.g., 1.1–1.2) to reduce loops.
  - stop to add stop strings.
  - *num_keep* (advanced): how many initial tokens to always keep when sliding the window.

After editing a Modelfile, re-run ollama create … -f Modelfile to rebuild that local model.

*** Create & test:
#+begin_src bash
ollama rm boyang/gemma3-4b-it:v1 2>/dev/null || true
#+end_src

#+end_src

#+begin_src console

  ollama run boyang/gemma3-4b-it:v1 -p "Explain context length in 3 short sentences."
#+end_src

* Run the Model
Run the model using the ollama run command as shown:
#+begin_src console
yanboyang713@Meta-Scientific-Linux ~ % ollama run gemma3:4b
>>> hello, where is the capital of China?
The capital of China is **Beijing**.

It's a huge, historic city and a major cultural and political center. 😊

Do you want to know anything more about Beijing?

>>> /bye
#+end_src
 
Doing so will start an Ollama REPL at which you can interact with the Gemma3 4B model.
* Customize Model Behavior with System Prompts
You can customize LLMs by setting system prompts for a specific desired behavior like so:
+ Set system prompt for desired behavior.
+ Save the model by giving it a name.
+ Exit the REPL and run the model you just created.
  
Say you want the model to always explain concepts or answer questions in plain English with minimal technical jargon as possible. Here’s how you can go about doing it:
#+begin_src file
>>> /set system For all questions asked answer in plain English avoiding technical jargon as much as possible
Set system message.
>>> /save ipe
Created new model 'ipe'
>>> /bye
#+end_src

Now run the model you just created:
#+begin_src bash
ollama run ipe
#+end_src

* How to use Ollama API
Ollama API reference link: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md

Access from local using curl
#+begin_src bash
  curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{ "model": "boyang/gemma3-4b-it:v1", "prompt": "How are you today?"}'
#+end_src
The format of the default response is not very friendly, let's add additional parameters to generate a single json object data, and the response is the return content.

#+begin_src bash
  curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{ "model": "boyang/gemma3-4b-it:v1", "prompt": "How are you today?", "stream": false}'
#+end_src
