* Set-up
[[id:9d293990-ff98-47eb-93a4-556df1e7b26d][kubeadm]] doesnâ€™t install [[https://devopscube.com/setup-prometheus-monitoring-on-kubernetes/][metrics server]] component during its initialization. We have to install it separately.

To verify this, if you run the top command, you will see the Metrics API not available error.
#+begin_src console
root@master-node:~# kubectl top nodes
error: Metrics API not available
#+end_src

To install the metrics server, execute the following metric server manifest file. It deploys metrics server version v0.6.2
#+begin_src bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yanboyang713/kubeadm-scripts/main/manifests/metrics-server.yaml
#+end_src

This manifest is taken from the official [[https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server][metrics server]] repo. I have added the --kubelet-insecure-tls flag to the container to make it work in the local setup and hosted it separately. Or else, you will get the following error.
#+begin_src bash
because it doesn't contain any IP SANs" node=""
#+end_src

Once the metrics server objects are deployed, it takes a minute for you to see the node and pod metrics using the top command.
#+begin_src bash
kubectl top nodes
#+end_src

You should be able to view the node metrics as shown below.
#+begin_src console
root@master-node:/home/vagrant# kubectl top nodes
NAME            CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
master-node     111m         5%     1695Mi          44%
worker-node01   28m          2%     1078Mi          57%
worker-node02   219m         21%    980Mi           52%
#+end_src

You can also view the pod CPU and memory metrics using the following command.
#+begin_src bash
kubectl top pod -n kube-system
#+end_src
