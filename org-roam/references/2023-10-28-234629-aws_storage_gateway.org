#+title: AWS Storage Gateway

AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you [[id:1988535e-9c15-4464-aa96-061b051e4370][Private Cloud (on-premises)]] access to virtually unlimited cloud storage.

Customers use Storage Gateway to simplify storage management and reduce costs for key hybrid cloud storage use cases.

These include moving backups to the cloud, using on-premises file shares backed by cloud storage, and providing low latency access to data in AWS for on-premises applications.

To support these use cases, Storage Gateway offers three different types of gateways:
+ File Gateway – provides file system interfaces to on-premises servers.
+ Volume Gateway – provides block-based access for on-premises servers.
+ Tape Gateway – provides a virtual tape library that is compatible with common backup software (block and file interfaces).
