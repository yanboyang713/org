Open RAN/O-RAN (from [[https://www.o-ran.org/][O-RAN alliance]]) takes [[id:fc55d9e0-251a-4558-9f4a-c92df3f3e43f][vRAN (Virtual RAN)]] to the next level. While traditionally [[id:fc55d9e0-251a-4558-9f4a-c92df3f3e43f][vRAN (Virtual RAN)]] is a closed network, as [[id:4fb3287a-23fb-4585-bd87-be76e4b4077f][Radio Unit (RU)]], [[id:50f525c2-9912-4a1a-972a-59626c963d51][DU]] and [[id:fea1dd7c-fe96-474d-af03-935b09b6ef4e][CU]], which are all part of the RAN must be bought from the same vendor.

The O-RAN alliance is working on specifications to open the interface between [[id:4fb3287a-23fb-4585-bd87-be76e4b4077f][Radio Unit (RU)]] and [[id:50f525c2-9912-4a1a-972a-59626c963d51][DU]] and further between [[id:50f525c2-9912-4a1a-972a-59626c963d51][DU]] and [[id:fea1dd7c-fe96-474d-af03-935b09b6ef4e][CU]]. This means that a customer can mix and match the components from different vendors without being locked to one vendor for all these three components, thus resulting in an open RAN network.

These new open components as per O-RAN allianceâ€™s specs are called O-RU, O-DU and O-CU (where O stands for Open) which is actually a modular base station software stack on off-the-shelf server hardware.
