* Directories
** Configuration files
Configuration files should be placed in the /etc directory. If there is more than one configuration file, it is customary to use a subdirectory in order to keep the /etc area as clean as possible. Use /etc/pkg where pkg is the name of the package (or a suitable alternative, eg, apache uses /etc/httpd/).

** General directory
Package files should follow these general directory guidelines:

| directory               | description                          |
|-------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| /etc                    | System-essential configuration files |
| /usr/bin                | Binaries                             |
| /usr/lib                | Libraries                            |
| /usr/include            | Header files                         |
| /usr/lib/pkg            | Modules, plugins, etc.               |
| /usr/share/doc/pkg      | Application documentation            |
| /usr/share/info         | GNU Info system files                |
| /usr/share/licenses/pkg | Application licenses                 |
| /usr/share/man          | Manpages                             |
| /usr/share/pkg          | Application data                     |
| /var/lib/pkg            | Persistent application storage       |
| /etc/pkg                | Configuration files for pkg          |
| /opt/pkg                | Large self-contained packages        |

/bin
/sbin
/dev
/home
/srv
/media
/mnt
/proc
/root
/selinux
