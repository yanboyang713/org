#+title: Removing and Installing SFP or XFP Modules

[[id:4a3a5aa0-abd1-47c2-8b34-6b75d1bd660b][SFP module]]

* latching devices
SFP modules use one of four different latching devices to install and remove the module from a port. The four types of SFP module-latching devices are described in the following sections:
+ Bale Clasp SFP Module
+ Mylar Tab SFP Module
+ Actuator Button SFP Module
+ Slide Tab SFP Module

* Installing a Bale Clasp SFP Module
To install this type of SFP module, follow these steps:

Step 1 Attach an ESD-preventive wrist strap or ankle strap according to the instructions provided.

Step 2 Close the bale clasp before inserting the SFP module.

Step 3 Line up the SFP module with the port, and slide it into the port.

*Note* Verify that the SFP modules are completely seated and secured in their assigned receptacles on the line card by firmly pushing on each SFP module. If the SFP module is not completely seated and secured in the receptacle, you will hear a click as the triangular pin at the bottom of the SFP module snaps into the hole in the receptacle.
