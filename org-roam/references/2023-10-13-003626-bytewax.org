#+title: Bytewax
Bytewax is an open source Python framework for building highly scalable dataflows in a streaming or batch context. It is based on the Timely Dataflow library, which is a dataflow processing library written in Rust. Bytewax provides a number of features that make it a powerful tool for building stream processing applications, including:

Dataflow programming: Bytewax uses a dataflow programming model, which means that program execution is conceptualized as data flowing through a series of operations or transformations. This makes it easy to build complex applications that process data in real time.
Stateful processing: Bytewax supports stateful processing, which means that some operations can remember information across multiple events. This is useful for applications that need to track the state of the world, such as fraud detection or anomaly detection.
Windowing: Bytewax supports windowing, which allows you to aggregate data over a period of time. This is useful for applications that need to track trends or patterns in data.
Connectors: Bytewax provides connectors to a variety of data sources, such as Kafka, Spark, and Redis. This makes it easy to connect your applications to the data that you need to process.
Bytewax is a relatively new framework, but it has a lot of potential. It is a good choice for organizations that are looking for a powerful and flexible stream processing framework that is written in Python.
