#+title: Attribute Construction
#+filetags:  

In the attribute construction method, the new attributes consult the existing attributes to construct a new data set that eases data mining. New attributes are created and applied to assist the mining process from the given attributes. This simplifies the original data and makes the mining more efficient.

For example, suppose we have a data set referring to measurements of different plots, i.e., we may have the height and width of each plot. So here, we can construct a new attribute 'area' from attributes 'height' and 'weight'. This also helps understand the relations among the attributes in a data set.
