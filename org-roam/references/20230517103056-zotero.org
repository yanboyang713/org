* Literature notes and citations
I (try to) take literature notes whenever I consume content that may contain helpful knowledge, be it papers, books, or videos.

The first step is to import the content into my reference management software of choice, Zotero. This guarantees that I have a record of all important metadata, a copy of the PDF/website/video, and a unique ID (the citation key) to refer to it.
** Install
#+begin_src bash
  paru -S zotero-beta-bin
#+end_src


In most cases, I use [[https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors][Zotero’s browser plugin]], which automates most parts of the import, although some cleanups are often required, such as:
+ Switching from title case to sentence case. Using sentence case is required to produce correct titles in all citation styles. The [[https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/][Better BibTeX plugin]] does this mostly automatically, though proper nouns need to be fixed manually afterward.
  
Spliting author names into pairs of last name, first name – this can usually be done automatically, but that can get confused by prefixes like “von.”
Changing the item type. Journal papers, conference papers, preprints, and theses aren’t always properly distinguished by the sites one imports the data from.
For YouTube videos, I usually need to change the item type to Presentation, fix up titles, add presenters, etc.
