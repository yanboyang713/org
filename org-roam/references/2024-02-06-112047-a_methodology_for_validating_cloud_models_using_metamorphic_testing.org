A methodology for validating cloud models using metamorphic testing
2015
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12243-014-0442-7
Proposes a methodology to test and validate cloud models by integrating simulation techniques and metamorphic testing. This approach addresses the challenges of testing cloud systems due to the many parameters and the difficulty in determining correct behavior. Metamorphic relations are used to semi-automatically generate and validate test cases for cloud models
