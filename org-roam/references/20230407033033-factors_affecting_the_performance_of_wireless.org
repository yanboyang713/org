#+filetags:

The reliability of [[id:55f23b66-c353-4562-b4bc-da3df9ddc665][wireless networks]] communication (WNC) is much lower than wired networks. WNC will impact by node overload, routing protocol, weather, obstacle blockage, and many other factors, all those [[id:039227e4-36f6-4b25-ab8b-941da3367c26][anomalies]] cannot be avoided.
