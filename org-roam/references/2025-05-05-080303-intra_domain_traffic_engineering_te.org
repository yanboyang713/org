#+title: intra-domain traffic engineering (TE)
#+date: 2025-05-05


Intra-domain Traffic Engineering (TE) refers to the methods and practices used within a single administrative network domain (like a single ISP or enterprise network) to optimize the utilization of network resources and enhance overall network performance.

*Key points about Intra-domain Traffic Engineering:*

* *Scope:*
  * Operates within a single Autonomous System (AS) or administrative network.
  * Does not involve cooperation or communication between different ISPs or domains.

* *Goals:*

  * Maximize efficient use of network resources (e.g., bandwidth, links, routers).
  * Balance network load to avoid congestion.
  * Minimize latency, jitter, and packet loss.
  * Ensure reliability and robustness by adapting to link failures or network issues.

* *Methods and Technologies:*

  * Routing protocols adjustments (e.g., OSPF, IS-IS).
  * Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for explicit route selection.
  * Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for dynamic and programmable path management.
  * Network monitoring and measurement tools for traffic load assessment and route optimization.

* *Limitations:*
  * Typically performed periodically (e.g., every few minutes or hours).
  * Primarily optimized around aggregate traffic demands and utilization metrics rather than per-flow QoS demands.
  * Does not handle end-to-end QoS across multiple domains or WANs (inter-domain).

* *Examples of Systems/Implementations:*
  * Google's B4 WAN.
  * Microsoft SWAN (Software-driven WAN).
  * Facebook's Express Backbone (Espresso).

*Contrast with Inter-domain TE:*
+ *Intra-domain TE*: Within a single administrative domain, optimizing internal resource usage.
+ *Inter-domain TE*: Across multiple domains (e.g., across different ISPs), optimizing path selection based on inter-domain routing protocols like BGP.
