#+filetags:
Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a symbol of the [[id:8feddd36-d37b-4fe8-9b70-96b97f63ae8f][fourth industrial revolution (4IR)]] by integrating physical and computational processes which can associate with humans in various ways.

In short, the relationship between Cyber networks and the physical component is known as CPS, which is assisting to incorporate the world and influencing our ordinary life significantly.

Currently, CPS is involved in modern society very vastly with many uptrend perspectives.

 A CPS comprises a monitoring system, generally, one or even more microcontrollers that regulate and transmit the information acquired from the sensors and actuators required to deal with the actual environment. A communication interface is also required for such embedded systems to share information with other embedded systems or the cloud.

 The most significant element of a CPS is information interchange, because information may be connected and analyzed centrally. A CPS, to look at it another way, is an embedded system that can communicate with other devices via a network. The Internet of things [6] is a term used to describe CPS that are hooked up to the internet.


Several technologies are intimately linked to the CPS for instance Sensor networks, IoT, wireless, and cloud computing. Wireless networks are thought to be an important part of CPS
The following parameters are included in internet technology perspectives.
+ Internet of Things (IoT): It entails using IP addresses to communicate with smart systems. This allows any physical device to be assigned its IP address [10].
+ Internet of Services (IoS): It includes new communication models such as those offered by service-oriented design (SOA) and REST technology [11].
+ Internet of Data (IoD): It allows for the efficient transmission and storage of large amounts of data, as well as the creation of innovative analytical techniques for analyzing large amounts of data [12].

in order to develop and implement resilient and reliable CPS networks. WSNs, wireless networks, WLANs, cloud-based networks, social networks, and other heterogeneous networks are all used in CPS [39,40].

Wireless sensor network topology optimization is a critical topic. A topology optimization approach for wireless sensor networks based on complex network theory and cyber-physical systems is developed using software-defined wireless sensor network architecture [43].

* Characteristics of CPS
** 3C
+ Computation in a CPS refers to the processing and analysis of data from physical and computational components to make decisions and control physical processes.
+ Communication in a CPS refers to the exchange of data between physical and computational components to facilitate control and monitoring of physical processes. This involves the use of communication networks and protocols to ensure that data is transmitted accurately and in a timely manner. Effective communication is critical in a CPS to ensure that physical processes are controlled and monitored accurately and in real-time.
+ Control in a CPS refers to the ability of the computational components to influence and manipulate physical processes. This involves the use of sensors, actuators, and other physical devices to monitor and manipulate the physical environment. The computational components of a CPS use data analysis and decision-making algorithms to determine the appropriate actions to take to achieve the desired control outcomes.
** 5C
+ Connection in a CPS, the physical and computational components must be connected and integrated with each other to achieve a specific function. This involves establishing communication channels between sensors, actuators, and other physical devices and the computational components, such as processors and communication networks.
+ Conversion in a CPS refers to the process of converting physical data into digital data that can be processed and analyzed by computational components. For example, in an autonomous vehicle, sensors detect the physical surroundings, and the data from those sensors is converted into digital data that is processed by the onboard computer to make decisions about the vehicle’s movement.
+ The term “cyber” in CPS refers to the computational components of the system, including hardware, software, and communication networks.
+ Cognition in a CPS refers to the system’s ability to process, analyze, and make decisions based on data from physical and computational components. This involves using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze data and make decisions about how to control physical processes.
+ Configuration in a CPS refers to the arrangement and setup of physical and computational components to achieve a specific function. Configuration is critical in ensuring that the CPS is optimized for its intended application and operates effectively and efficiently.
** NIFU
+ A CPS is typically composed of multiple physical and computational components that need to communicate with each other to achieve the desired functionality. A network, such as a wired or wireless communication network, is used to establish communication between these components.
+ The intelligence of a CPS refers to the system’s ability to process data, learn from data, and make decisions based on data. This involves using algorithms and techniques such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytic to analyze data from physical and computational components. The intelligence of a CPS enables it to optimize physical processes, improve safety and efficiency, and enable intelligent automation.
+ The functionality of a CPS refers to its ability to perform a specific task or achieve a specific goal. The functionality of a CPS can vary widely depending on the application, and can range from simple tasks, such as adjusting temperature and lighting in a smart home, to complex tasks, such as controlling an autonomous vehicle.
+ User-friendliness in a CPS refers to the ease of use and intuitiveness of the system’s interface. This involves designing the system with the user’s needs and preferences in mind and providing an interface that is easy to navigate and understand. A user-friendly CPS can help ensure that the system is used effectively and efficiently and can help reduce the potential for errors or accidents.
