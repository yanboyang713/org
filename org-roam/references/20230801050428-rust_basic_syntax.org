#+title: Rust Basic Syntax
#+filetags:

* Introduction
Much of the Rust syntax will be familiar to you from C, C++ or Java:
+ Blocks and scopes are delimited by curly braces.
+ Line comments are started with //, block comments are delimited by /* ... */.
+ Keywords like if and while work the same.
+ Variable assignment is done with =, comparison is done with ==.
