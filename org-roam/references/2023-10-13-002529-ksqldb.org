SQL interface: ksqlDB uses a SQL interface, which makes it familiar to most developers.
Stream processing: ksqlDB can be used to process streaming data in real time.
Relational database model: ksqlDB uses a relational database model, which makes it easy to store and query data.
Scalability: ksqlDB is scalable and can be deployed on a variety of platforms.
Reliability: ksqlDB is reliable and can handle high volumes of data.
KsqlDB can be deployed on a variety of platforms, including Confluent Cloud. When ksqlDB is deployed on Confluent Cloud, it is managed by Confluent and is automatically provisioned, scaled, and updated. This makes it easy to get started with ksqlDB and to focus on building applications rather than managing infrastructure.
