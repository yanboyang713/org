* Requirements
+ CPU requirements: Your CPU has to support hardware virtualization and IOMMU. Most new CPUs support this.
+ Motherboard requirements: Your motherboard needs to support IOMMU. Lists can be found on the Xen wiki and Wikipedia. Note that, as of writing, both these lists are incomplete and very out-of-date and most newer motherboards support IOMMU.
