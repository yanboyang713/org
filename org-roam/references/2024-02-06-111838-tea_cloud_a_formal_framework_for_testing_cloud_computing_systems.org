TEA-Cloud: A Formal Framework for Testing Cloud Computing Systems
2021
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165965
Proposes a framework that integrates simulation with testing methods for validating both functional and nonfunctional aspects of cloud systems, utilizing metamorphic testing to overcome the lack of an oracle for result verification. This framework, TEA-Cloud, was evaluated through empirical studies using fault seeding and metamorphic relations (MRs) for different cloud configurations, demonstrating its potential in finding all seeded faults
