#+title: Hyperparameter Tuning with MLflow and Optuna

[[id:64aa42dc-14c2-48c4-8360-45a31aa73f7f][MLFlow]]
[[id:eddad456-1d3b-46f0-8f90-39efca21fd6a][optuna]]
we venture into a frequent use case of MLflow Tracking: hyperparameter tuning

our focal points will be:
+ Introducing the capabilities of MLflow for tracking hyperparameter tuning
+ Understanding the distinction between parent and child runs in MLflow
+ Delving into the components of MLflow and their relevance in our workflow
+ Discovering and navigating experiments, parent runs, and child runs in the MLflow UI
+ Conducting a comparative analysis of runs to understand the nuances of hyperparameter tuning
