#+title: Centroid-based Clustering

Centroid-based clustering organizes the data into non-hierarchical clusters, in contrast to hierarchical clustering defined below. k-means is the most widely-used centroid-based clustering algorithm. Centroid-based algorithms are efficient but sensitive to initial conditions and outliers. This course focuses on k-means because it is an efficient, effective, and simple clustering algorithm.
