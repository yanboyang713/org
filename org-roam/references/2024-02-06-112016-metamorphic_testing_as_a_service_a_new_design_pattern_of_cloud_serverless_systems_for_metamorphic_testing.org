METAMORPHIC TESTING-AS-A-SERVICE: A NEW DESIGN PATTERN OF CLOUD SERVERLESS SYSTEMS FOR METAMORPHIC TESTING
2022
Discusses the development of a new MTaaS design pattern for cloud serverless systems to improve the software code quality metrics. This pattern facilitates metamorphic testing in the cloud by decomposing metamorphic relations into individual parts with automatic code generation, thereby improving the maintainability and class coupling metrics without worsening other metrics
