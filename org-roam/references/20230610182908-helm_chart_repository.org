* What is a chart repository?
A chart repository is an HTTP server that houses packaged charts and an index.yaml file. That file has an index of all the charts in the repository. A chart repository can be any HTTP server that can serve YAML and .tar files and can answer GET requests. Therefore, you have many options for hosting your chart repository. You can use a Google Cloud Storage bucket, an Amazon S3 bucket, GitHub pages, or you can create a web server.
