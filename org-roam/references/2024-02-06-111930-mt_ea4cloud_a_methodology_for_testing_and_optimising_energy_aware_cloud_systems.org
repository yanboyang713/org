MT-EA4Cloud: A Methodology For Testing and Optimising Energy-Aware Cloud Systems
2020
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121220300054
Presents a formal approach combining metamorphic testing, evolutionary algorithms, and simulation to check the correctness of cloud systems from an energy-aware perspective and optimize their energy consumption. This methodology uses metamorphic testing to model the underlying cloud infrastructure in the form of metamorphic relations and addresses the oracle problem by generating appropriate test suites focused on the features reflected in the metamorphic relations
