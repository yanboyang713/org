Electronic schematic and [[id:2d3e6a13-ef56-44f5-a5dd-3d14b061d177][printed circuit board (PCB)]] design tools

* Installation and Setup
** install
#+begin_src bash
paru -S kicad
#+end_src
** Configure Libraries
After installation, configure the footprint and symbol libraries. These libraries contain the components you'll use in your designs.

* Creating a New Project
Start a New Project: Open KiCad and create a new project. This will generate a project directory with files like *.pro*, *.sch*, and *.kicad_pcb*.

Project Structure: The *.pro* file is the project file, the *.sch* file is the schematic file, and the *.kicad_pcb* file is the PCB layout file.

* Schematic Design
Open Eeschema: Eeschema is KiCad's schematic capture tool. Open your project's schematic file to start designing your circuit.
Add Components: Use the 'Place Symbol' tool to add components to your schematic. Components are selected from the symbol libraries.
Wire Components: Use the 'Place Wire' tool to connect the components. This defines the electrical connections between components.

* Assign Footprints
Footprint Assignment: Each component in your schematic needs a corresponding footprint for the PCB layout. Use the 'Assign Footprints' tool to match components to their footprints.
Footprint Libraries: Footprints are stored in libraries similar to symbols. Make sure you have the necessary libraries loaded.

* PCB Layout
Open Pcbnew: Pcbnew is KiCad's PCB layout tool. Open your project's PCB file to start designing the physical layout.
Import Schematic Netlist: Import the netlist from your schematic to ensure that all connections are correctly transferred to the PCB layout.
Place Components: Arrange the components on the board. Pay attention to placement for optimal routing and performance.
Route Traces: Connect the components with copper traces. Use the 'Route Tracks' tool to draw the connections.
Design Rules: Set up design rules to ensure your PCB meets manufacturing specifications, such as trace width and spacing.

* Generating Outputs
Gerber Files: Generate Gerber files for manufacturing. Gerber files are the standard format for PCB production.
Bill of Materials (BOM): Generate a BOM to list all the components needed for your PCB.

* Simulation and Verification
ERC and DRC: Perform Electrical Rules Check (ERC) and Design Rules Check (DRC) to verify your schematic and PCB layout.
Simulation: KiCad integrates with SPICE simulators for circuit simulation. You can simulate your circuit to ensure it works as expected.

* Additional Tools
3D Viewer: Use the 3D viewer to visualize your PCB in three dimensions. This helps in verifying component placement and overall design.
Plugins and Scripts: Extend KiCad's functionality with plugins and scripts. There are many community-developed tools available.
