#+title: prevent laptop lid suspending

To prevent Proxmox from suspending when the laptop lid is closed, you can modify the system's power management settings. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Access Proxmox via SSH or Console:** Log in to your Proxmox server using SSH or the console.

2. **Edit Logind Configuration:**
   - Open the `logind.conf` file for editing. You can use a text editor like `nano` or `vi`. The command might look like this:
     ```bash
     nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf
     ```
   - In this file, find the line that starts with `#HandleLidSwitch=suspend`. If it's commented out (as indicated by the `#` at the beginning), you need to uncomment it (remove the `#`) and change its value.
   - Change it to:
     ```bash
     HandleLidSwitch=ignore
     ```
   - This tells the system to ignore the lid switch, thereby preventing it from suspending when the lid is closed.

3. **Restart the Systemd Logind Service:**
   - After saving the changes, restart the systemd logind service to apply the new settings. This can be done with the following command:
     ```bash
     systemctl restart systemd-logind
     ```

4. **Verify the Changes:**
   - To ensure the changes have taken effect, close the laptop lid and check if Proxmox continues to run without going into suspend mode.

5. **Check for Other Power Management Settings:**
   - Sometimes, other power management tools or settings might override this configuration. Ensure no other power management settings are conflicting with your new configuration.

6. **Regularly Update Your System:**
   - Keep your Proxmox system updated, as updates might overwrite your configuration. After updates, it's a good idea to check if the `logind.conf` file still has your desired settings.

7. **Documentation and Help:**
   - For more detailed information or troubleshooting, refer to the Proxmox documentation or community forums.

Remember that changing system settings can have unintended consequences, so it's always a good idea to have backups and understand the changes you're making.
