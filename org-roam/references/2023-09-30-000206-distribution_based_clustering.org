#+title: Distribution-based Clustering

This clustering approach assumes data is composed of distributions, such as Gaussian distributions. In Figure 3, the distribution-based algorithm clusters data into three Gaussian distributions. As distance from the distribution's center increases, the probability that a point belongs to the distribution decreases. The bands show that decrease in probability. When you do not know the type of distribution in your data, you should use a different algorithm.
