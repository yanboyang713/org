* What is Data Sanitization?
Data sanitization involves purposely, permanently deleting, or destroying data from a storage device, to ensure it cannot be recovered.

Ordinarily, when data is deleted from storage media, the media is not really erased and can be recovered by an attacker who gains access to the device. This raises serious concerns for [[id:278645d6-efd7-4127-a748-e309c118efbe][security]] and data [[id:56e1bcab-97ff-4fbe-acdf-9573a142d697][privacy]]. With sanitization, storage media is cleansed so there is no leftover data on the device, and no data can be recovered, even with advanced forensic tools.
