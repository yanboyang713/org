#+title: Time Series Notation
#+filetags:

A number of different notations are in use for time-series analysis.

A common notation specifying a time series $X$ that is indexed by the natural numbers is written

$$X = (X_{1}, X_{2}, ...)$$

Another common notation is

$$Y = (Y_{t}: t \in T)$$

where $T$ is the index set.
