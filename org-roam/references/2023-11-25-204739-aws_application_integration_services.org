#+title: AWS application integration services

The AWS application integration services are a family of services that enable decoupled communication between applications.

These services provide decoupling for microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

AWS application integration services allow you to connect apps, without needing to write custom code to enable interoperability.

Decoupled applications can interoperate whilst being resilient to the failure or overload of any individual component.

The following services are involved with application integration:
