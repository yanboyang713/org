RisingWave is an open-source distributed SQL streaming database designed for the cloud. It is designed to reduce the complexity and cost of building real-time applications. RisingWave consumes streaming data, performs incremental computations when new data comes in, and updates results dynamically. As a database system, RisingWave maintains results in its own storage so that users can access data efficiently.

Some of the key features of RisingWave:

Distributed architecture: RisingWave is a distributed database that can be scaled horizontally to handle large amounts of data.
SQL interface: RisingWave provides a SQL interface that allows users to query streaming data in a familiar way.
Incremental computations: RisingWave performs incremental computations when new data comes in, which reduces the processing time and allows for low latency queries.
Materialized views: RisingWave supports materialized views, which allow users to define the data they need and have it pre-computed for efficient querying.
Cloud-native architecture: RisingWave is designed to be deployed and managed in the cloud, which makes it easy to scale and manage.
RisingWave is fully open-sourced so that you can easily deploy.
