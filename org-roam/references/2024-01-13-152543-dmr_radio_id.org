#+title: DMR Radio ID

* What Is A DMR Radio ID?
A Radio ID is a unique number assigned to you (and your callsign) by the RadioID.net Team. Like a telephone number or IP address, your Radio ID identifies you as a unique radio user on the various DMR networks and repeaters around the world. Because DMR is digital, we have so much more that we can do with the RF flowing to and from our radios. For example, because of Radio IDs we can see and display the callsign of the person talking to us on the radio face by the use of the RadioID.net Database. Every time you PTT your DMR radio, your Radio ID gets transmitted to the DMR network and everyone can see who you are.  Pretty cool, right? BUT DON’T FORGET.. YOU MUST STILL ID BY VOICE TO BE LEGAL! Even though your callsign shows up in the network logs and on other users radios does not mean you are identifying yourself a licensed ham. You must ID like you do on analog.

So why else is this so cool? Identifying every radio and repeater uniquely with an ID enables the very essence of DMR networking to function. i.e making private calls to each other, organizing specific talkgroups for countries, states, regions, cities, clubs, special interest groups etc.

In short, a Radio ID enables you to talk to and hear only the people and traffic that you want to.

It’s totally free to get your Radio ID and you NEED ONE if you are going to have a DMR radio and use it. Is it the law? No. But you aren’t going to enjoy using DMR unless you have one, so do yourself a favor and get registered with RadioID.net as soon as you buy a DMR Radio.

It’s easy to register with RadioID.net and get your own Radio ID.  Just click the button below, read the entire page to understand what you are about to do, then click the USER REGISTRATION button at the bottom of the RadioID.net page.
The procedure looks something like this:

In order to complete the account registration and get an ID you must get the official FCC document to up load to their site to complete the registration.
An original Government Document with your Callsign clearly visible. This is the only way to verify you are the License Holder. A ‘Screen shot’ of a webpage, or the ‘Reference Doc’ can be taken by anyone and are NOT acceptable.

For US Citizens, you can follow these steps:

    The FRN and password are the same you use when applying for Vanity callsigns and address changes.
    If you don’t know your FRN number, go to FCC ULS License Search and search for your callsign. Your FRN will be listed in the column FRN.
2. On the left side menu, click on ‘Download Electronic Authorizations’.
3. On the new page, select the callsign you wanna print the license for and click on the button ‘ADD >’.
4. Now, on the bottom right of the page, click on the button ‘Download >’. Make sure your pop-up blocker is disable, otherwise you won’t be able to download the PDF for your license.
5. You will be asked to save a PDF file. Save it and submit it to RadioID, Simply login to your account and upload the License again.
That’s it. You will receive an email, usually within 24 hours, with your unique Radio ID, which you can promptly program into your radio(s).
