The dynamics of the real-world networks are non-linear and their underlying topology is time-varying [25]. However, complex networks with linear dynamics have been intensively researched recently [26, 27], which can be motivated in several ways. Firstly, non-linear dynamics on the networks can be approximated [28] or bounded [20] by the linear dynamics, in most cases. Secondly, the notion of controlling complex networks has become an important research question [27, 29]. In system theory, non-linear system control is a difficult problem, which has been developed on previously well-established linear system control theory [30].
