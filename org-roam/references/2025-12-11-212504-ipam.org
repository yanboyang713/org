* Definition
*IP Address Management (IPAM)* is the administration of DNS and DHCP, which are the network services that assign and resolve IP addresses to machines in a TCP/IP network.

It is a means of planning, tracking, and managing the IP address space used in a network. IPAM software tools enable administrators to ensure that the inventory of assignable IP addresses remains current and sufficient.

* Key Functions
+ *Tracking:* Monitoring which IP addresses are in use, by which device, and since when.
+ *Planning:* Visualizing subnet usage to determine when new subnets are needed.
+ *Management:* organizing IP space into a hierarchy (e.g., by location, department, or VLAN).
+ *Automation:* Integrating with DHCP and DNS servers to automatically update records when devices join or leave the network (often referred to as *DDI*: DNS, DHCP, and IPAM).
