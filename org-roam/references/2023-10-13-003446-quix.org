Quix Platform is a complete system that enables you to develop, debug, and deploy real-time streaming data applications. Quix provides an online IDE and an open-source stream processing library called Quix Streams. Quix Streams is a client library that can be used in Python or C# code to develop custom elements of a processing pipeline.

Quix Platform was built on top of a message broker, specifically Kafka, rather than on top of a database, as databases introduce latency that can result in problems in real-time applications, and can also present scaling issues. Quix Platform helps abstract these issues, providing you with a scaleable and cost-effective solution.

From the top-down, the Quix stack provides the following:
