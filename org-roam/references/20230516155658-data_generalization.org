#+title: Data Generalization
#+filetags:  

It converts low-level data attributes to high-level data attributes using concept hierarchy. This conversion from a lower level to a higher conceptual level is useful to get a clearer picture of the data. Data generalization can be divided into two approaches:

+ Data cube process (OLAP) approach.
+ Attribute-oriented induction (AOI) approach.

For example, age data can be in the form of (20, 30) in a dataset. It is transformed into a higher conceptual level into a categorical value (young, old).
