* What is MLflow?
Whether youâ€™re an individual researcher, a member of a large team, or somewhere in between, MLflow provides a unified platform to navigate the intricate maze of model development, deployment, and management. MLflow aims to enable innovation in ML solution development by streamlining otherwise cumbersome logging, organization, and lineage concerns that are unique to model development. This focus allows you to ensure that your ML projects are robust, transparent, and ready for real-world challenges.
