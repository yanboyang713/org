* Introduction
MeshtasticÂ® is a project that enables you to use inexpensive LoRa radios as a long range off-grid communication platform in areas without existing or reliable communications infrastructure. This project is 100% community driven and open source!
* Features
+ Long range (331km record by MartinR7 & alleg)
+ No phone required for mesh communication
+ Decentralized communication - no dedicated router required
+ Encrypted communication
+ Excellent battery life
+ Send and receive text messages between members of the [[id:5ac44b73-e515-4d5d-899e-0cc0277b3d55][mesh]]
+ Optional GPS based location features
+ And more!

* How it works
Meshtastic utilizes [[id:35782e84-1ad7-4497-96f7-15893cdcddd8][LoRa]], a long-range radio protocol, which is widely accessible in most regions without the need for additional licenses or certifications, unlike ham radio operations.

These radios are designed to rebroadcast messages they receive, forming a mesh network. This setup ensures that every group member, including those at the furthest distance, can receive messages.

Additionally, Meshtastic radios can be paired with a single phone, allowing friends and family to send messages directly to your specific radio. It's important to note that each device is capable of supporting a connection from only one user at a time.
