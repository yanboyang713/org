* what is cloud init
Cloud-init is an open-source initialization tool that automates the configuration of cloud instances, virtual machines (VMs), and bare-metal machines during their first boot. It acts as the industry standard for cross-platform cloud instance initialization and is supported by all major public cloud providers.

Its key functions include:
- *Automated Configuration*: Streamlines deployment by applying settings automatically, reducing manual effort.
- *Task Execution*: Handles tasks like setting hostname, configuring network, creating user accounts, installing software, and running scripts.
- *User Data and Metadata*: Uses "user data" (YAML configuration instructions) and "metadata" (cloud platform data) to configure instances.
- *Consistency and Reusability*: Allows consistent and reliable deployments across multiple instances.
- *Integration*: Provides the "glue" between launching a cloud instance and connecting to it.
