* Introduction
rsyslog is a syslog implementation that offers many benefits over syslog-ng. It can be configured to receive log entries from systemd's journal in order to process or filter them before quickly writing them to disk or sending them over network.

*NOTE:* It is recommended to disable and uninstall the syslog-ng package to prevent possible conflicts.
