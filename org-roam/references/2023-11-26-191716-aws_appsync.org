#+title: AWS AppSync

AWS AppSync makes it easy to build data-driven mobile and browser-based apps that deliver responsive, collaborative experiences by keeping the data updated when devices are connected, enabling the app to use local data when offline, and synchronizing the data when the devices reconnect.

AWS AppSync uses the open standard [[id:31693316-a212-406c-9c34-32fa88de914a][GraphQL]] query language so you can request, change, and subscribe to the exact data you need with just a few lines of code.
