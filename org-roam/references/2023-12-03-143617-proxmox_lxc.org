#+title: proxmox LXC

[[id:77bd7428-f1ee-4306-8d5a-62f38134dfc5][Proxmox VE]] uses [[id:2c382716-6c15-4385-945f-e5f64e0c0b6e][Linux Containers (LXC)]] as its underlying container technology. The “Proxmox Container Toolkit” (pct) simplifies the usage and management of LXC, by providing an interface that abstracts complex tasks.

Containers are tightly integrated with Proxmox VE. This means that they are aware of the cluster setup, and they can use the same network and storage resources as virtual machines. You can also use the Proxmox VE firewall, or manage containers using the HA framework.

The primary goal is to offer an environment that provides the benefits of using a VM, but without the additional overhead. This means that Proxmox Containers can be categorized as “System Containers”, rather than “Application Containers”.

NOTE: If you want to run application containers, for example, Docker images, it is recommended that you run them inside a Proxmox Qemu VM. This will give you all the advantages of application containerization, while also providing the benefits that VMs offer, such as strong isolation from the host and the ability to live-migrate, which otherwise isn’t possible with containers.

Container images, sometimes also referred to as “templates” or “appliances”, are tar archives which contain everything to run a container.

Proxmox VE itself provides a variety of basic templates for the most common Linux distributions. They can be downloaded using the GUI or the pveam (short for Proxmox VE Appliance Manager) command line utility. Additionally, TurnKey Linux container templates are also available to download.

The list of available templates is updated daily through the pve-daily-update timer. You can also trigger an update manually by executing:
#+begin_src bash
pveam update
#+end_src

To view the list of available images run:
#+begin_src bash
pveam available
#+end_src

You can restrict this large list by specifying the section you are interested in, for example basic system images:
List available system images:

Before you can use such a template, you need to download them into one of your storages. If you’re unsure to which one, you can simply use the local named storage for that purpose. For clustered installations, it is preferred to use a shared storage so that all nodes can access those images.
#+begin_src bash
  pveam download local ubuntu-22.10-standard_22.10-1_amd64.tar.zst
  pveam download local ubuntu-22.04-standard_22.04-1_amd64.tar.zst
#+end_src

#+begin_src console
root@richie:~# pveam list local
NAME                                                         SIZE  
local:vztmpl/ubuntu-20.04-standard_20.04-1_amd64.tar.gz      204.28MB
