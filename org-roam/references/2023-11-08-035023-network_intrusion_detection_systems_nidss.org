Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are important tools for the protection of computer networks against increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber attacks.

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) aim to detect network attacks and to preserve the three principles of information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability
