* What does the C-rating mean on a LiPo battery?
The C-rating or ‘Coulomb’ rating of a battery represents the amount of continuous current a lithium polymer battery can provide under load. Basically, the higher the C-rating of the battery, the more power it can provide to your racing drone. To calculate the maximum theoretical current a battery can provide, simply multiply the LiPo C-rating by the capacity of the battery in mAh / 1000.

For example, a 1300mAh 80C battery can theoretically provide 1.3Ah * 80C = 104A.

This means that both the capacity of the battery, and the C-rating contribute to the maximum current a battery can draw in continuous supply
