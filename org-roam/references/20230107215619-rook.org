* What is Rook?
Rook is an open source cloud-native storage orchestrator for [[id:b60301a4-574f-43ee-a864-15f5793ea990][Kubernetes]], providing the platform, framework, and support for Ceph storage to natively integrate with Kubernetes.

[[id:c625aa5e-187f-4776-b28c-0bb4b7df9198][Ceph]] is a distributed storage system that provides file, block and object storage and is deployed in large scale production clusters.

Rook automates deployment and management of Ceph to provide self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. The Rook operator does this by building on Kubernetes resources to deploy, configure, provision, scale, upgrade, and monitor Ceph.
