* JumpServer vs Teleport
Both [[id:d2f2e153-26c6-4f2a-997c-5f92486157a4][JumpServer]] and [[id:836940ff-9e16-4f32-bae4-1000cfe80138][Teleport]] are modern Privileged Access Management (PAM) and bastion host solutions, but they have different architectural philosophies and target audiences.

** Comparison Overview

** JumpServer
JumpServer is a widely used open-source bastion host and PAM solution, particularly popular in Asia. It focuses on being a comprehensive operation and maintenance (O&M) platform.

*** Pros
- *User Friendly:* Excellent web-based terminal (Luna) that requires no client installation.
- *Legacy Support:* Strong support for traditional assets like legacy servers, network devices (switches/routers via Telnet/SSH), and Windows (RDP).
- *All-in-One:* Includes asset management, auth management, and session auditing in one cohesive package.
- *Community:* Very large open-source community usage (though heavily Chinese-centric documentation/community).

*** Cons
- *Architecture:* More traditional "gateway" model rather than a pure zero-trust certificate model.
- *Complexity:* Can be heavy to deploy full HA clusters compared to Teleport's single binary approach.

** Teleport
Teleport positions itself not just as a bastion, but as an "Access Plane" that replaces traditional VPNs and static keys with identity-based security.

*** Pros
- *Zero Trust:* Strictly uses short-lived certificates for SSH/K8s. No static keys are managed or stored on servers.
- *Unified Access:* Single gateway for SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters, Databases (Postgres, MySQL, etc.), and internal Web Apps.
- *Developer Friendly:* "tsh" CLI tool is very powerful and integrates well into developer workflows.
- *Modern stack:* Written in Go, highly performant, and designed for dynamic cloud environments (auto-scaling groups, ephemeral nodes).

*** Cons
- *Learning Curve:* The certificate-based model requires a shift in mindset from traditional SSH key management.
- *Licensing Changes:* Recent changes to the Community Edition binaries (requiring enterprise license for large orgs) have made the free version less accessible for big companies compared to purely permissive OSS.

** Recommendation
- Choose *JumpServer* if you need a robust, traditional PAM solution for a mixed environment (legacy hardware, Windows, Linux) and want a great web-based management experience for operations teams.
- Choose *Teleport* if you are a cloud-native organization (using Kubernetes, AWS/GCP) looking to implement Zero Trust security, eliminate static SSH keys, and unify access for developers and SREs.
