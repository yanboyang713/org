Summary

In the video presentation regarding SD-RAN version 1.5, presenters Wuan Kim and Hayun Menou discuss significant improvements and changes from the previous version (1.4), and provide insights into upcoming release plans for version 1.6. They explain that the release introduces major enhancements in application integration, specifically the transition to official service models, updates within the 5G RAN framework, and a shift from a Jenkins-based CI pipeline to GitHub Actions. Additionally, they announce the eventual deprecation of the “SD-RAN in a box” model in favor of deploying components using Ether architecture. The presentation outlines use cases supported by the current version, highlights new updates, and touches on system requirements for deployments.

Highlights
📈 Transition to Official Service Models: Major applications like PCI, MLB, and MH now utilize the official ORRC service model, enhancing compatibility.
⚙️ Integration with 5G RAN Framework: SD-RAN v1.5 incorporates base models aiding in deployment with OI 5G RAN technology.
🔗 New Deployment Tools with Ether: Transition from “SD-RAN in a box” to Ether architecture for deployment, promoting efficiency and scalability.
🔄 Modern CI Implementation: The move to GitHub Actions from Jenkins streamlines the build and test process, increasing speed and reducing bottlenecks.
💻 Deprecation of Python Components: Python-based SDKs and applications are deprecated due to lack of resources, with notes on future potential revival based on demand.
📊 Consistent Use Case Support: Continued support for existing use cases while addressing service model updates and architectural necessities.
🗓️ Future Planning for v1.6: Plans to bridge gaps between SD-RAN and other projects by updating old versions and including enhancements like SRS RAN.
Key Insights

🚀 Transition from Community to Official Models:

The shift from ONF community service models to established ORRC service models for key applications like PCI, MLB, and MH creates a pathway for industry-standard compliance and support, addressing compatibility with new commercial hardware and aiming for broader adoption of SD-RAN technology.

🛠️ Move to Ether for Deployment:

The strategic transition to Ether architecture for deployment over “SD-RAN in a box” emphasizes a focus on larger-scale deployments. Ether allows easier management of multi-host environments, ensuring better orchestration of complex networks commonly found in real-world applications.

⚙️ CI Pipeline Overhaul:

Switching from Jenkins to GitHub Actions for the CI/CD process reduces overhead associated with virtual machine provisioning, significantly speeding up test cycles and streamlining the development workflow, which is crucial for agile responses in high-tech environments.

📉 Deprecation of Python Components:

The decision to deprecate Python-based SDKs is significant, revealing the project’s resource limitations. It serves as an opportunity to pivot towards focused development on more impactful technologies, emphasizing resource allocation for priority areas which have direct implications on how development can respond to user needs.

🔄 Integration with Commercial Frameworks:

Integrating SD-RAN with existing commercial hardware showcases a move towards ubiquitous adaptability in telecommunications. By utilizing the OI 5G RAN stack, SD-RAN can now support more dynamic and scalable network solutions.

📊 Use Case Consistency:

Maintaining support for existing use cases underscores a solid foundation for ongoing development in SD-RAN. The ability to adapt existing frameworks effectively ensures that the system remains relevant and capable of meeting industry demands.

📆 Future Development in v1.6:

Strategic plans are laid out for v1.6, focusing on aligning SD-RAN more closely with leading open-source initiatives, thereby bridging discrepancies and upgrading system components to newer versions that counter security and compatibility issues, aiming for a.

Overall, SD-RAN v1.5 signifies a transformative phase, equipping the architecture with vital upgrades while preparing for future developments in the rapidly evolving telecommunications landscape. As the project continues to mature, addressing gaps with systematic updates, enhanced integrations, and modernized deployment strategies is pivotal in maintaining its relevance and operational efficiency. The presentation effectively emphasizes that this latest iteration is a stepping stone for even more ambitious advancements in imminent versions.
