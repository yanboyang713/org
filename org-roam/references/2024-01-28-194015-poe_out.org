* PoE-Out Modes
Some model does NOT support auto-on mode

** auto-on mode
If auto-on is selected on PoE-Out interface, then port operates in this strict order:

PSE with low voltage checks for resistance on the connected port. If the detected resistance range is between (3kΩ to 26.5kΩ) power is turned on;
When power is applied, the PSE continuously checks if the overload limit is not reached or short circuit detected
If the cable is unplugged, the port returns in detection state and will remain off until suitable PD is detected
** forced-on mode
If forced-on is selected then port operates in this strict order:

PSE disables resistance check on the port, and apply power on pins 4,5 (+) and 7,8 (-), even if no cable is attached
When power is applied, PSE still continuously checks if an overload or short circuit is not detected
After the cable is unplugged, the power still remains enabled on the port.
** off mode
If off mode is used, PoE-Out on the port will be turned off, no detection will take place, and the interface will behave like a simple Ethernet port.
