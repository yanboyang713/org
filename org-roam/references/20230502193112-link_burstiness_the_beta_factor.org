#+title: Link burstiness—the $\beta$ factor
#+filetags:  

Link burstiness—the $\beta$ factor characterizes the burstiness of a wireless link. It is a scalar value, with 0 being an independent link and 1 being a perfectly bursty link. The $\beta$ factor is derived from the conditional probability delivery function of the measured link. $\beta = \frac{KW(I) - KW(E)}{KW(I)}$, where I is an independent link with the same PRR as the measured link and E is the measured link. $KW (\cdot)$ is the Kantorovich–Wasserstein distance of a link to the perfectly bursty link. The KW distance is defined as the average of the absolute differences of the corresponding elements of two vectors. It is shown that with increasing inter-packet interval, $\beta$ comes close to 0.
