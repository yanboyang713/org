#+title: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a distributed queue system.

Amazon SQS enables you to send, store, and receive messages between software components.

An Amazon SQS queue is a temporary repository for messages that are awaiting processing.

The SQS queue acts as a buffer between the component producing and saving data, and the component receiving the data for processing.

This is known as decoupling / loose coupling and helps to enable elasticity for your application.

Amazon SQS is pull-based, not push-based (like [[id:98fb0462-344b-4de7-82f7-45710bfddf85][Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)]]).
