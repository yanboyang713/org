* Docker

When we refer to containers, we almost always mean Docker containers (https://www.docker.com/). Docker is the most popular software tool for running programs in containers, which are isolated environments.

Containerization is a kind of virtualization where the scope of the application's resources is limited. This means the application works at its maximum performance level. This is different from full virtualization, where you have to run the full operating system with the corresponding overhead and run your application inside that isolated operating system.

* Arch Installation
#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -S docker
sudo systemctl start docker.service
#+end_src

If you want to avoid typing sudo whenever you run the docker command, add your username to the docker group:

Create the docker group.
#+begin_src bash
sudo groupadd docker
#+end_src

Add your user to the docker group.
#+begin_src bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
#+end_src

To apply the new group membership, log out of the server and back in, or type the following:

#+begin_src bash
su - ${USER}
#+end_src

You will be prompted to enter your user’s password to continue.

Confirm that your user is now added to the docker group by typing:
#+begin_src console
(base) yanboyang713@boyang:~/Documents/docker-as-dev-environment$ id -nG
yanboyang713 adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare microk8s docker
#+end_src

If you need to add a user to the docker group that you’re not logged in as, declare that username explicitly using:
#+begin_src bash
sudo usermod -aG docker username
#+end_src

The rest of this article assumes you are running the docker command as a user in the docker group. If you choose not to, please prepend the commands with sudo.

Let’s explore the docker command next.

Test Docker
#+begin_src bash
docker info
#+end_src
