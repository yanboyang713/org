Recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of positives events that you predicted correctly as shown below:

We can obtain the accuracy score from scikit-learn, which takes as inputs the actual labels and the predicted labels
#+begin_src python
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score
recall_score(df.actual_label.values, df.predicted_RF.values)
#+end_src
