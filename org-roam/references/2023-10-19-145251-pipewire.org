PipeWire saw itself as a powerful contender to replace PulseAudio.

* Installing PipeWire
If you want to take the plunge and install PipeWire on your system, you first have to make sure you're not already running it!

Type pactl info into a terminal and see what it gives you under "Server Name." If it gives you "on PipeWire" in parentheses, you're already running PipeWire.
#+begin_src console
yanboyang713@Meta-Scientific-Linux ~ % pactl info
Server String: /run/user/1000/pulse/native
Library Protocol Version: 35
Server Protocol Version: 35
Is Local: yes
Client Index: 85
Tile Size: 65472
User Name: yanboyang713
Host Name: Meta-Scientific-Linux
Server Name: PulseAudio (on PipeWire 0.3.82)
Server Version: 15.0.0
Default Sample Specification: float32le 2ch 48000Hz
Default Channel Map: front-left,front-right
Default Sink: alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo
Default Source: alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo
Cookie: 0380:3b9d

If the terminal only shows you "PulseAudio" without anything following it, your system isn't running PipeWire.

** Installing The Service
Every PipeWire installation starts with the base service. There's a chance this may have already been installed with your distro, but just in case it isn't, you can install it with the following commands.

On Arch-based systems:
#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S pipewire pipewire-alsa
#+end_src

** Installing The Session Manager
PipeWire doesn't have its own connection logic, so you have to install a session manager. WirePlumber is one that offers more granular configuration as well as extra plugins that can enhance your experience:

On Arch-based systems:
#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -S wireplumber
#+end_src

If you prefer a simpler version or your distro's official repositories don't have WirePlumber, you can simply install PipeWire Media Session:

On Arch-based systems:
#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -S pipewire-media-session
#+end_src

** Installing The PulseAudio Daemon
Since a large proportion of your system's applications still send out calls to PulseAudio, if you want your audio to work properly, you'll have to install PipeWire's daemon that listens for PulseAudio stuff.

On Arch-based systems:

#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -S pipewire-pulse
#+end_src

** Removing Traces of PulseAudio
If you had to confirm the removal of PulseAudio because of a conflict with something else you were installing during this process (usually pipewire-pulse), then you can skip this step.

Otherwise, it's important now to remove PulseAudio from your system so that it doesn't try to query it.

On Arch-based systems:
#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -Rns pulseaudio
#+end_src

** Getting Services Ready
With all the packages you've installed and uninstalled, it is time to get PipeWire up and running.

First, remove remnants of pulseaudio's services:
#+begin_src bash
systemctl --user --now disable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket
systemctl --user mask pulseaudio
#+end_src

Enable PipeWire's services. If you installed WirePlumber:
#+begin_src bash
systemctl --user --now enable pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber
#+end_src

If you installed PipeWire Media Session, use:
#+begin_src bash
systemctl --user --now enable pipewire pipewire-pulse pipewire-media-session
#+end_src
PipeWire should now work perfectly after you reboot your system!

** GUI
qpwgraph â€” Qt-based Graph/Patchbay for PipeWire, inspired by the JACK tool QjackCtl. Saves wire sets.
#+begin_src bash
paru -S qpwgraph
#+end_src

* Configuration
The PipeWire package provides an initial set of configuration files in /usr/share/pipewire. You should not edit these files directly, as package updates will overwrite your changes. To configure PipeWire, you can copy files from /usr/share/pipewire to the alternate system-wide location /etc/pipewire, or to the user location ~/.config/pipewire. An equally named file in a directory with a higher precedence makes the analogous files ignored.

** Simultaneous output
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1379376/how-to-achieve-automated-simultaneous-outputs-with-pipewire

Run:
#+begin_src bash
  pactl load-module module-combine-sink
#+end_src

permanent:
copying /usr/share/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf to ~//.config/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf and adding:
#+begin_src bash
  mkdir -p ~/.config/pipewire/ && cp -p /usr/share/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf
#+end_src

#+begin_src file
context.exec = [
    { path = "pactl"  args = "load-module module-combine-sink" }
]
#+end_src
Then saving the file.
