[[id:fd9fc710-20ed-404d-a8e6-01c9fcf72edd][AWS Databases]]

Serverless [[id:fac64e37-1193-4e37-861d-0a4769b45320][graph database]] designed for superior scalability and availability.

Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets.

With Amazon Neptune, you can create sophisticated, interactive graph applications that can query billions of relationships in milliseconds.

SQL queries for highly connected data are complex and hard to tune for performance. Instead, Amazon Neptune allows you to use the popular graph query languages Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and W3Câ€™s SPARQL to execute powerful queries that are easy to write and perform well on connected data.
