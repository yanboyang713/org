The paper *"LogNIC: A High-Level Performance Model for SmartNICs"* proposes a packet-centric analytical model to help developers reason about the performance of SmartNIC-offloaded applications *without deep hardware knowledge*. Here's a summary and information about the SmartNICs it uses:

---

* *Problem
SmartNICs (Smart Network Interface Cards) are widely used in modern data centers for offloading packet processing tasks from CPUs. However, *developing optimized SmartNIC applications is complex*, due to hardware heterogeneity, overlapping computation/I/O, and traffic-dependent performance.

* *Solution
The authors introduce *LogNIC*, a *high-level performance model* for SmartNICs that abstracts hardware details and models performance based on *packet traversal* through execution graphs comprising compute engines, memory hierarchies, and interconnects.

*Key Features of LogNIC:*
- Models *latency and throughput* using a *directed acyclic graph (DAG)* abstraction of SmartNIC execution.
- Considers interleaved traffic, multiple tenants, and accelerator variability.
- Offers both *estimation mode* (predicts performance) and *optimizer mode* (suggests configurations to meet performance goals).
- Inspired by and extends architectural models like Roofline, LogCA, and Accelerometer.

*Evaluation Results:*
- Validated using real SmartNICs, LogNIC accurately estimates performance with *<1% error* in some scenarios.
- It helps optimize parallelism and placement decisions, improving *throughput by up to 36.4%* and *latency by up to 22.8%*.
- Can also guide early-stage *hardware design decisions*.

* Which SmartNICs Are Used?
