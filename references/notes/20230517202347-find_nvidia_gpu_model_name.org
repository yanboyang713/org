#+title: Find NVIDIA GPU Model Name
#+filetags:  

[[id:d6be6fc0-4aa7-45a7-bc65-e81f2a0723a2][Nvidia]]

please update your PCI ID database with:
#+begin_src bash
sudo update-pciids
#+end_src

And use the following command in your terminal:
#+begin_src bash
lspci -nn | grep '\[03'
#+end_src

You will see the model name of your graphic card. If it's ambiguous, you could search the PCI ID (something like [10de:11bc]) on the Internet for the corrent model name.
