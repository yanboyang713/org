Big Bang Deployment is quite straightforward, where we just roll out a new version in one go with service downtime. Preparation is essential for this strategy. We roll back to the previous version if the deployment fails.

+ Have service downtime (short) causes have to shutdown the old system to switch on new one
+ roll back still might disrupt users and there could be data implication.

Big Bang is sometimes the only choice, for example, when an intricate database upgrade is involved.
