A *measurement* occurs when a variable is actually measured or recorded.

For example, you measure a personâ€™s heart rate (measurement). Heart rate is measured on a scale, or the unit of measurement, for example, beats per minute (BPM). A set of measurement or records from a variable is called data and can come from either a sample, a sub group of a population, or the population itself. When an entire population is measured, this is referred to as a census.
