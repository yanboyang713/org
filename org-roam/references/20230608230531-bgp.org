They often depend on Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) support to cross autonomous system (AS) boundaries, which could be a potential security concern in some cloud sites [31]. BGP suffers from its security vulnerabilities, such as BGP hijack [32], route leaks [33], etc. Alternatively, the ‘hybrid Layer-2/Layer-3 solutions’ (i.e., Layer-2 for intra-host and Layer-3 for interhost) may facilitate efficient intra-host, and scalable inter-host, communication.
