The family's other products provide this platform through different environments: OKD serves as the community-driven upstream (akin to the way that Fedora is upstream of Red Hat Enterprise Linux), Several deployment methods are available including self-managed, cloud native under ROSA (Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS), ARO (Azure Red Hat OpenShift) and RHOIC (Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud) on [[id:dcf5e347-8a8a-4c63-a822-53f558025f8c][AWS]], [[id:c40c4861-f09d-4bc2-a606-d2b62cc533f9][Azure]] , and IBM Cloud respectively, OpenShift Online as software as a service, and OpenShift Dedicated as a managed service.
