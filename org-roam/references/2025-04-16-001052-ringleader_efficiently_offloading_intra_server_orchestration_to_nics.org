* *Why it matters*
Modern cloud servers juggle thousands of microsecond‑scale RPCs from many services. Ideal orchestration (load‑balancing, request scheduling, and fast CPU core re‑allocation) is centralized, but existing *software‑only* schemes burn cores and stall at high line‑rates. SmartNICs with on‑board ARM cores help little—they are too slow and still add latency. RingLeader asks: *what if we push (almost) the entire orchestration logic into the NIC’s datapath hardware?*
