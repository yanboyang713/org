* Decision-making models (workflow)
** OODA loop (observe, orient, decide, act)

** PDCA / PDSA (Shewhart–Deming cycle)
Plan → Do → Check/Study → Act. Continuous improvement for stable processes and operations. Great for post-mortems and process tuning.

** DMAIC (Six Sigma)
Define → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Control. Data-driven improvement when you can instrument the process and reduce variation.

** Recognition-primed decision (RPD)
Recognition-primed decision (RPD) is a model of how people make quick, effective decisions when faced with complex situations. In this model, the decision maker is assumed to generate a possible course of action, compare it to the constraints imposed by the situation, and select the first course of action that is not rejected.

** Cynefin Framework
Sense-making for context: clear, complicated, complex, chaotic. Helps you pick the style of decision-making (analyze vs. probe-and-learn vs. act-to-stabilize).

** DECIDE (aviation ADM)
DECIDE is a six-step model for Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) that pilots use to make systematic and safe choices during flight. The steps are Detect, Estimate, Choose, Identify, Do, and Evaluate. This structured process helps pilots manage risks and react effectively to changing circumstances, which is critical as human error is a factor in many aviation accidents.

The DECIDE model
+ D - Detect: Recognize that a change has occurred or a situation has developed. This could be anything from a change in engine sound to a new weather condition.
+ E - Estimate: Assess the impact of the change. Determine if it is likely to affect the flight's safety and if a reaction is needed.
+ C - Choose: Select a desired outcome or goal. This could be a simple action, like turning on the pitot heat, or a major one, such as selecting a landing field after an engine failure.
+ I - Identify: Take action to achieve the chosen outcome. This involves identifying the specific steps required to implement the decision.
+ D - Do: Perform the action that was identified.
+ E - Evaluate: Monitor the results of the action taken to see if it was effective. If not, the pilot may need to start the process again.
  
How it's used in aviation
+ Risk management: DECIDE is a key tool within the broader framework of Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) to manage and mitigate risks in the cockpit.
+ Structured process: It provides a logical and continuous loop for making decisions, especially under pressure, which can be just as dangerous as taking no action at all.
+ Continuous application: The model is applied from before the flight begins to after it has ended, ensuring a systematic approach throughout the entire process.

** Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP)
The Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP) is a seven-step structured methodology used by military commanders and their staff to plan and execute missions. It guides them from receiving a mission to producing a detailed operation plan by organizing planning activities, developing courses of action (COAs), analyzing and comparing them, and finally producing the plan. The process includes: Receipt of Mission, Mission Analysis, COA Development, COA Analysis, COA Comparison, COA Approval, and Orders Production.

** Kepner–Tregoe Decision Analysis
Kepner-Tregoe (KT) decision analysis is a structured, systematic approach for evaluating alternatives and making decisions by clarifying objectives, evaluating options against those objectives, and assessing risks. It is the fourth phase of the broader Kepner-Tregoe problem-solving methodology and involves defining the desired outcomes, prioritizing them as "musts" and "wants," and then systematically comparing each alternative against the defined criteria. The process helps to ensure a balanced, data-driven decision where benefits clearly outweigh risks.
