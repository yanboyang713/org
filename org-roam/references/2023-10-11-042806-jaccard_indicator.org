#+title: Jaccard indicator

The Jaccard Similarity, also known as the Jaccard Index or Jaccard Coefficient, is a measure of similarity between two sets. It is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the two sets:

$J(A,B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}$

* Explanation
1. Measure the similarity of two sets
2. |X| Stands for the number of elements of set X
3. Jaccard distance = 1 âˆ’ Jaccard similarity

  def jaccard_similarity(set_a, set_b):
    """Compute the Jaccard Similarity between two sets."""
    intersection = len(set_a.intersection(set_b))
    union = len(set_a.union(set_b))
    return intersection / union if union != 0 else 0.0

# Example usage:
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {"b", "c", "d"}
similarity = jaccard_similarity(set1, set2)
print(f"Jaccard Similarity: {similarity}")
