#+title: Packet Corruption Rate (PCR)
#+filetags:

Packet Corruption Rate (PCR)} is a metric that calculates the ratio of received corrupted packets (failing CRC) to the total number of received packets (passing the preamble and SFD check) in a given link. A slightly different metric definition is used in [68], which relates it to the ratio of the received corrupted packets to the sent packets. The metric is a link quality metric that reflects the degree of packet corruption, normally caused by interference or jamming attacks.
