#+title: vertical line feature extraction

Vertical line feature extraction is an essential technique in the realm of image processing and computer vision, facilitating the identification and analysis of vertical structures within a digital image. This process involves the implementation of algorithms that can discern vertical lines from other elements in the image. Typically, edge detection methods, such as the Sobel or Canny algorithms, are employed to highlight areas of high-intensity gradient, which often correspond to the edges of objects. Subsequently, these detected edges are analyzed using techniques like the Hough Transform, which is particularly effective in isolating features with specific orientations, such as vertical lines.
