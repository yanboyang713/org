* AWS Migration Hub
[[id:dcf5e347-8a8a-4c63-a822-53f558025f8c][AWS]] Migration Hub provides a single location to track the progress of application migrations across multiple AWS and partner solutions.
Using Migration Hub allows you to choose the AWS and partner migration tools that best fit your needs, while providing visibility into the status of migrations across your portfolio of applications.
For example, you might use AWS Database Migration Service, AWS Server Migration Service, and partner migration tools such as ATADATA ATAmotion, CloudEndure Live Migration, or RiverMeadow Server Migration SaaS to migrate an application comprised of a database, virtualized web servers, and a bare metal server.
Using Migration Hub, you can view the migration progress of all the resources in the application.

* AWS Database Migration Service
AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely.

The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database.

The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases.

AWS Database Migration Service supports homogenous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora.

With AWS Database Migration Service, you can continuously replicate your data with high availability and consolidate databases into a petabyte-scale data warehouse by streaming data to Amazon Redshift and Amazon S3.
