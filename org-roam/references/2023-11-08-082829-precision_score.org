#+title: precision score

Precision is the fraction of predicted positives events that are actually positive as shown below:

We can obtain the accuracy score from scikit-learn, which takes as inputs the actual labels and the predicted labels
#+begin_src python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score
precision_score(df.actual_label.values, df.predicted_RF.values)
#+end_src

what would you do if one model was better at recall and the other was better at precision. One method that some data scientists use is called the [[id:db48b1d7-cfe2-46df-ac13-c4c1afb1ea32][F1 score]].
