#+title: Metamorphic Relations for Detection of Performance Anomalies

Metamorphic Relations for Detection of Performance Anomalies: This paper explores the application of metamorphic relations to improve performance testing, specifically by comparing successive runs of software to detect performance anomalies. The study involved using a metamorphic relation for page load times to discover and repair a race condition in the Adobe Experience Platform Launch Tag Manager. This approach to performance testing, including the use of Gaussian Mixture Models and the Silverman Test for Multimodality to automatically determine modality in performance measures, could potentially be adapted for testing and analyzing the performance of load balancing systems. Metamorphic relations involving these performance measures can alert engineers to the presence of anomalies in systems, including those managed by load balancers
