#+title: Single-hop throughput
#+filetags:

Single-hop throughput measures the successful delivery of packet payload over a link within a specified time period. In the absence of interference from other concurrently active links and noise, the single-hop throughput should approach the maximum attainable data rate of the link. Additionally, higher link quality typically results in higher single-hop throughput, as fewer packet retransmissions are needed to deliver the packet over the link.
