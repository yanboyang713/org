Amazon LightSail databases are instances that are dedicated to running databases.

An Amazon LightSail database can contain multiple user-created databases, and you can access it by using the same tools and applications that you use with a stand-alone database.

Amazon LightSail managed databases provide an easy, low maintenance way to store your data in the cloud.

Amazon LightSail manages a range of maintenance activities and security for your database and its underlying infrastructure.

Amazon LightSail automatically backs up your database and allows point in time restore from the past 7 days using the database restore tool.

Amazon LightSail databases support the latest major versions of MySQL. Currently, these versions are 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0 for MySQL.

Amazon LightSail databases are available in Standard and High Availability plans.

High Availability plans add redundancy and durability to your database, by automatically creating standby database in a separate Availability Zone.

Amazon LightSail is very affordable.

Amazon LightSail plans are billed on an on-demand hourly rate, so you pay only for what you use.

For every Amazon LightSail plan you use, we charge you the fixed hourly price, up to the maximum monthly plan cost.
