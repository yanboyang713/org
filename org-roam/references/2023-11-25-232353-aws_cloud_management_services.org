* AWS Personal Health Dashboard
AWS Personal Health Dashboard provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may impact you.

Personal Health Dashboard gives you a personalized view into the performance and availability of the AWS services underlying your AWS resources.

The dashboard displays relevant and timely information to help you manage events in progress.

Also provides proactive notification to help you plan for scheduled activities.

Alerts are triggered by changes in the health of AWS resources, giving you event visibility, and guidance to help quickly diagnose and resolve issues.

You get a personalized view of the status of the AWS services that power your applications, enabling you to quickly see when AWS is experiencing issues that may impact you.

Also provides forward looking notifications, and you can set up alerts across multiple channels, including email and mobile notifications, so you receive timely and relevant information to help plan for scheduled changes that may affect you.

Alerts include remediation details and specific guidance to enable you to take immediate action to address AWS events impacting your resources.

Can integrate with Amazon CloudWatch Events, enabling you to build custom rules and select targets such as AWS Lambda functions to define automated remediation actions.

The AWS Health API allows you to integrate health data and notifications with your existing in-house or third-party IT Management tools.

* Service Health Dashboard
AWS publishes up-to-the-minute information on service availability.

This information is not personalized to you (unlike Personal Health Dashboard).

* AWS OpsWorks
AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet.

Updates include patching, updating, backup, configuration, and compliance management.

* AWS Trusted Advisor
AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you real time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.

Trusted Advisor checks help optimize your AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce your overall costs, and monitor service limits.

AWS Basic Support and AWS Developer Support customers get access to 6 security checks (S3 Bucket Permissions, Security Groups – Specific Ports Unrestricted, IAM Use, MFA on Root Account, EBS Public Snapshots, RDS Public Snapshots) and 50 service limit checks.

AWS Business Support and AWS Enterprise Support customers get access to all 115 Trusted Advisor checks (14 cost optimization, 17 security, 24 fault tolerance, 10 performance, and 50 service limits) and recommendations.

* AWS CloudFormation
AWS CloudFormation provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment.

CloudFormation allows you to use a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts.

This file serves as the single source of truth for your cloud environment.

You can use JSON or YAML to describe what AWS resources you want to create and configure.
