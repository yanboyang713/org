#+title: switch stacking

Switch stacking in networking is a technique used to connect multiple network switches together to form a single logical unit. This setup simplifies management and expands the network's capacity without requiring separate configurations for each switch.

multiple physical switches would function and be managed as if they were a single larger switch.
