Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.

Relational databases are known as Structured Query Language (SQL) databases.

Non-relational databases are known as NoSQL databases.

RDS is an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) type of database.
RDS features and benefits:
+ SQL type of database.
+ Can be used to perform complex queries and joins.
+ Easy to setup, highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable.
+ Used when data is clearly defined.
+ Common use cases include online stores and banking systems.

Amazon RDS supports the following database engines:
+ SQL Server.
+ Oracle.
+ MySQL Server.
+ [[id:97a5c070-1745-4002-b5fe-0d170877ba3f][PostgreSQL]]
+ Aurora
+ MariaDB.
  
Aurora is Amazon’s proprietary database.
RDS is a fully managed service and you do not have access to the underlying EC2 instance (no root access).

The RDS service includes the following:
+ Security and patching of the DB instances.
+ Automated backup for the DB instances.
+ Software updates for the DB engine.
+ Easy scaling for storage and compute.
+ Multi-AZ option with synchronous replication.
+ Automatic failover for Multi-AZ option.
+ Read replicas option for read heavy workloads.
  
A DB instance is a database environment in the cloud with the compute and storage resources you specify.

Encryption:
+ You can encrypt your Amazon RDS instances and snapshots at rest by enabling the encryption option for your Amazon RDS DB instance.
+ Encryption at rest is supported for all DB types and uses AWS KMS.
+ You cannot encrypt an existing DB, you need to create a snapshot, copy it, encrypt the copy, then build an encrypted DB from the snapshot.
  
DB Subnet Groups:
+ A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets (typically private) that you create in a [[id:7aed7e4c-350e-4322-b5f7-52b860fe75cb][AWS virtual private cloud (VPC)]] and that you then designate for your DB instances.
+ Each DB subnet group should have subnets in at least two Availability Zones in each region.
+ It is recommended to configure a subnet group with subnets in each AZ (even for standalone instances).

AWS Charge for:
+ DB instance hours (partial hours are charged as full hours).
+ Storage GB/month.
+ I/O requests/month – for magnetic storage.
+ Provisioned IOPS/month – for RDS provisioned IOPS SSD.
+ Egress data transfer.
+ Backup storage (DB backups and manual snapshots).
  
Scalability:
+ You can only scale RDS up (compute and storage).
+ You cannot decrease the allocated storage for an RDS instance.
+ You can scale storage and change the storage type for all DB engines except MS SQL.
  
RDS provides multi-AZ for disaster recovery which provides fault tolerance across
availability zones:
+ Multi-AZ RDS creates a replica in another AZ and synchronously replicates to it (DR only).
+ There is an option to choose multi-AZ during the launch wizard.
+ AWS recommends the use of provisioned IOPS storage for multi-AZ RDS DB instances.
+ Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable.
+ You cannot choose which AZ in the region will be chosen to create the standby DB instance.
  
Read Replicas – provide improved performance for reads:
+ Read replicas are used for read heavy DBs and replication is asynchronous.
+ Read replicas are for workload sharing and offloading.
+ Read replicas provide read-only DR.
+ Read replicas are created from a snapshot of the master instance.
+ Must have automated backups enabled on the primary (retention period > 0).

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Pricing
RDS pricing is determined by:
+ Clock hours of server uptime – amount of time the DB instance is running.
+ Database characteristics – e.g. database engine, size, and memory class.
+ Database purchase type – e.g. On-Demand, Reserved.
+ Number of database instances.
+ Provisioned storage – backup is included up to 100% of the size of the DB. After the DB is terminated backup storage is charged per GB per month.
+ Additional storage – the amount of storage in addition to the provisioned storage is charged per GB per month.
+ Requests – the number of input and output requests to the DB.
+ Deployment type – single AZ or multi-AZ.
+ Data transfer – inbound is free, outbound data transfer costs are tiered.
+ Reserved Instances – RDS RIs can be purchased with No Upfront, Partial Upfront, or All Upfront terms. Available for Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle and SQL Server.
