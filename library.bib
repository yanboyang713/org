  abstract = {Self-determination, the combination of skills, knowledge, and beliefs that enable a person to engage in goal-directed, self-regulated, autonomous behavior, has become an important part of special education and related services for people with disabilities. Research on the outcomes of self-determination interventions has been sparse. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review of literature and used quantitative methods of meta-analysis to investigate what self-determination interventions have been studied, what groups of individuals with disabilities have been taught self-determination, and what levels of outcomes have been achieved using self-determination interventions. Fifty-one studies were identified that intervened to promote one or more components of self-determination; 22 were included in meta-analyses. The median effect size across 100 group intervention comparisons (contained in 9 studies) was 1.38. In contrast, 13 single subject studies included 18 interventions and produced a median percentage of nonoverlapping data (PND) of 95\% with a range of 64\% to 100\%. Seven of the interventions had a PND of 100\%, suggesting strong effects. Although all components of self-determination were reflected in this research, most focused on teaching choice making to individuals with moderate and severe mental retardation or self-advocacy to individuals with learning disabilities or mild mental retardation. The outcomes are discussed regarding the need to demonstrate that self-determination can be taught and learned, and can make a difference in the lives of individuals with disabilities.},

  abstract = {Major cloud providers o↵er networks of virtual machines with private IP addresses as a service on the cloud. To isolate the address space of di↵erent customers, customers are required to tunnel their tra c to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway, which is typically a middlebox inside the cloud that internally tunnels each packet to the correct destination. To improve performance, an increasing number of enterprises connect directly to the cloud provider's network at the edge, to a device we call the provider's edge (PE). PE is a chokepoint for customer's tra c to the cloud, and therefore a natural candidate for implementing network functions concerning customers' virtual networks, including the VPN gateway, to avoid a detour to middleboxes inside the cloud. At the scale of today's cloud providers, VPN gateways need to maintain information for around a million internal tunnels. We argue that no single commodity device can handle these many tunnels while providing a high enough port density to connect to hundreds of cloud customers at the edge. Thus, in this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture for the PE, consisting of a commodity switch, connected to a commodity server which uses Data-Plane Development Kit (DPDK) for fast packet processing. This architecture enables a variety of network functions at the edge by o↵ering the benefits of both hardware and software data planes. We implement a scalable VPN gateway on our proposed PE and show that it matches the scale requirements of today's cloud providers while processing packets close to line rate.},

  abstract = {Many proposals have demonstrated the efficiency advantages of software-defined networking (SDN) in managing data center networks. Common practices employ centralized traffic engineering (TE) in the SDN control plane to optimize load balancing and throughput. Meanwhile, for high availability purposes, the control plane is partitioned to ensure the impact of a single faulty controller is contained. However, the interaction between these two aspects is often overlooked. In particular, we show that the current control plane partitioning approach leads to imbalanced link loads and degraded application performance. To address this issue, we propose virtual slicing, a new control plane partitioning scheme. Virtual slicing achieves desirable traffic engineering performance while retaining the availability guarantees from the current approach. Virtual slicing is implemented and evaluated with real-world and synthetic traffic traces on production spine-free data center networks. Results show that virtual slicing reduces tail link utilizations by up to 28.4 \%, and improves flow completion times by up to 36 \%.},

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of microservices architecture in modern software systems has emphasized the need for efficient management of distributed services. While stateless mi-croservices enable straightforward migration, stateful microser-vices introduce added complexity due to the need to preserve in-memory state during migration. However, most container orchestrators, including Kubernetes, lack native support for live stateful service migration. This paper proposes an optimized migration scheme for stateful services in Kubernetes by integrating the Message-based Stateful Microservice Migration (MS2M) framework with Kubernetes' Forensic Container Checkpointing (FCC) feature. Key enhancements include support for migrating StatefulSet-managed Pods and the introduction of a Threshold-Based Cutoff Mechanism to handle high incoming message rates. Evaluation results demonstrate that MS2M for individual Pods reduces downtime by 96.986\% compared to cold migration methods, while the StatefulSet approach provides greater flexibility in managing stateful services. These insights provide practical strategies for optimizing stateful microservice migration in cloud-native environments.},

  abstract = {Outlier detection is an extensive research area, which has been intensively studied in several domains such as biological sciences, medical diagnosis, surveillance, and traffic anomaly detection. This paper explores advances in the outlier detection area by finding anomalies in spatio-temporal urban traffic flow. It proposes a new approach by considering the distribution of the flows in a given time interval. The flow distribution probability (FDP) databases are first constructed from the traffic flows by considering both spatial and temporal information. The outlier detection mechanism is then applied to the coming flow distribution probabilities, the inliers are stored to enrich the FDP databases, while the outliers are excluded from the FDP databases. Moreover, a k-nearest neighbor for distance-based outlier detection is investigated and adopted for FDP outlier detection. To validate the proposed framework, real data from Odense traffic flow case are evaluated at ten locations. The results reveal that the proposed framework is able to detect the real distribution of flow outliers. Another experiment has been carried out on Beijing data, the results show that our approach outperforms the baseline algorithms for high-urban traffic flow.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of networked devices, systems, and applications that we depend on every day makes managing networks more important than ever. The increasing security, availability, and performance demands of these applications suggest that these increasingly difficult network management problems be solved in real time, across a complex web of interacting protocols and systems. Alas, just as the importance of network management has increased, the network has grown so complex that it is seemingly unmanageable. In this new era, network management requires a fundamentally new approach. Instead of optimizations based on closed-form analysis of individual protocols, network operators need data-driven, machine-learning-based models of end-to-end and application performance based on high-level policy goals and a holistic view of the underlying components. Instead of anomaly detection algorithms that operate on offline analysis of network traces, operators need classification and detection algorithms that can make real-time, closed-loop decisions. Networks should learn to drive themselves. This paper explores this concept, discussing how we might attain this ambitious goal by more closely coupling measurement with real-time control and by relying on learning for inference and prediction about a networked application or system, as opposed to closed-form analysis of individual protocols.},

  abstract = {The wide adoption of the emerging SmartNIC technology creates new opportunities to offload application-level computation into the networking layer, which frees the burden of host CPUs, leading to performance improvement. Shuffle, the all-to-all data exchange process, is a critical building block for network communication in distributed data-intensive applications and can potentially benefit from SmartNICs.             In this paper, we develop SmartShuffle, which accelerates the data-intensive application's shuffle process by offloading various computation tasks into the SmartNIC devices. SmartShuffle supports offloading both low-level network functions, including data partitioning and network transport, and high-level computation tasks, including filtering, aggregation, and sorting. SmartShuffle adopts a coordinated offload architecture to make sender-side and receiver-side SmartNICs jointly contribute to the benefits of shuffle computation offload. SmartShuffle carefully manages the tight and time-varying computation and memory constraints on the device. We propose a liquid offloading approach, which dynamically migrates operators between the host CPU and the SmartNIC at runtime such that resources in both devices are fully utilized.             We prototype SmartShuffle on the Stingray SoC SmartNICs and plug it into Spark. Our evaluation shows that SmartShuffle improves host CPU efficiency and I/O efficiency with lower job completion time. SmartShuffle outperforms Spark, and Spark RDMA by up to 40\% on TPC-H.},

  abstract = {Trends indicate that emerging SmartNICs, either from different vendors or generations from the same vendor, exhibit substantial differences in hardware parallelism and memory interconnects. These variations make porting programs across NICs highly complex and time-consuming, requiring programmers to significantly refactor code for performance based on each target NIC's hardware characteristics. We argue that an ideal SmartNIC compilation framework should allow developers to write target-independent programs, with the compiler automatically managing cross-NIC porting and performance optimization. We present such a framework, Alkali, that achieves this by (1) proposing a new intermediate representation for building flexible compiler infrastructure for multiple NIC targets and (2) developing a new iterative parallelism optimization algorithm that automatically ports and parallelizes the input programs based on the target NIC's hardware characteristics.},

  abstract = {Programmable NICs have diverse uses, and there is a need for a NIC platform that can offload computation from multiple co-resident applications to many different types of substrates, including hardware accelerators, embedded FPGAs, and embedded processor cores. Unfortunately, there is no existing NIC design that can simultaneously support a large number of diverse offloads while ensuring high throughput/low latency, multi-tenant isolation, flexible offload chaining, and support for offloads with variable performance. This paper presents PANIC, a new programmable NIC. There are two new key components of the PANIC design that enable it to overcome the limitations of existing NICs: 1) A high-performance switching interconnect that scalably connects independent engines into offload chains, and 2) A new hybrid push/pull packet scheduler that provides cross-tenant performance isolation and low-latency load-balancing across parallel offload engines. From experiments performed on an 100 Gbps FPGA-based prototype, we find that this design overcomes the limitations of state-of-the-art programmable NICs.},

  abstract = {Modern society is increasingly moving toward complex and distributed computing systems. The increase in scale and complexity of these systems challenges O\&M teams that perform daily monitoring and repair operations, in contrast with the increasing demand for reliability and scalability of modern applications. For this reason, the study of automated and intelligent monitoring systems has recently sparked much interest across applied IT industry and academia. Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) has been proposed to tackle modern IT administration challenges thanks to Machine Learning, AI, and Big Data. However, AIOps as a research topic is still largely unstructured and unexplored, due to missing conventions in categorizing contributions for their data requirements, target goals, and components. In this work, we focus on AIOps for Failure Management (FM), characterizing and describing 5 different categories and 14 subcategories of contributions, based on their time intervention window and the target problem being solved. We review 100 FM solutions, focusing on applicability requirements and the quantitative results achieved, to facilitate an effective application of AIOps solutions. Finally, we discuss current development problems in the areas covered by AIOps and delineate possible future trends for AI-based failure management.},

We use both models for traffic characterization, called Digital Signature of Network Segment using Flow analysis (DSNSF), and volume anomaly or outliers detection. The DSNSFs obtained by the presented models are compared to the actual traffic of bits and packets of a real network environment and then subjected to specific evaluations in order to measure its accuracy. The presented models are capable of providing feedback through its predictive capabilities and hence provide an early warning system.},

O-RAN promotes virtualized RANs where disaggregated components are connected via open interfaces and optimized by intelligent controllers. The result is a new paradigm for the RAN design, deployment, and operations: O-RAN networks can be built with multi-vendor, interoperable components, and can be programmatically optimized through a centralized abstraction layer and data-driven closed-loop control. Therefore, understanding O-RAN, its architecture, its interfaces, and workflows is key for researchers and practitioners in the wireless community. In this article, we present the first detailed tutorial on O-RAN. We also discuss the main research challenges and review early research results. We provide a deep dive of the O-RAN specifications, describing its architecture, design principles, and the O-RAN interfaces. We then describe how the O-RAN RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) can be used to effectively control and manage 3GPP-defined RANs. Based on this, we discuss innovations and challenges of O-RAN networks, including the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) workflows that the architecture and interfaces enable, security and standardization issues. Finally, we review experimental research platforms that can be used to design and test O-RAN networks, along with recent research results, and we outline future directions for O-RAN development.},

  abstract = {Microscopic traffic simulators are important tools for studying transportation systems as they describe the evolution of traffic to the highest level of detail. A major challenge to microscopic simulators is the slow simulation speed due to the complexity of traffic models. We have developed the Scalable Microscopic Adaptive Road Traffic Simulator (SMARTS), a distributed microscopic traffic simulator that can utilize multiple independent processes in parallel. SMARTS can perform fast large-scale simulations. For example, when simulating 1 million vehicles in an area the size of Melbourne, the system runs 1.14 times faster than real time with 30 computing nodes and 0.2s simulation timestep. SMARTS supports various driver models and traffic rules, such as the car-following model and lane-changing model, which can be driver dependent. It can simulate multiple vehicle types, including bus and tram. The simulator is equipped with a wide range of features that help to customize, calibrate, and monitor simulations. Simulations are accurate and confirm with real traffic behaviours. For example, it achieves 79.1\% accuracy in predicting traffic on a 10km freeway 90 minutes into the future. The simulator can be used for predictive traffic advisories as well as traffic management decisions as simulations complete well ahead of real time. SMARTS can be easily deployed to different operating systems as it is developed with the standard Java libraries.},

  abstract = {In linear algebra, a matrix is in echelon form if it has the shape resulting from a Gaussian elimination.  A matrix being in row echelon form means that Gaussian elimination has operated on the rows, and column echelon form means that Gaussian elimination has operated on the columns. In other words, a matrix is in column echelon form if its transpose is in row echelon form. Therefore, only row echelon forms are considered in the remainder of this article. The similar properties of column echelon form are easily deduced by transposing all the matrices.  Specifically, a matrix is in row echelon form if all rows consisting of only zeroes are at the bottom. the leading coefficient (also called the pivot) of a nonzero row is always strictly to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above it.Some texts add the condition that the leading coefficient must be 1.These two conditions imply that all entries in a column below a leading coefficient are zeros.The following is an example of a 3{\texttimes}5 matrix in row echelon form, which is not in reduced row echelon form (see below):                                   [                                                                           1                                                                          a                                            0                                                                                                                  a                                            1                                                                                                                  a                                            2                                                                                                                  a                                            3                                                                                                                           0                                                     0                                                     2                                                                          a                                            4                                                                                                                  a                                            5                                                                                                                           0                                                     0                                                     0                                                     1                                                                          a                                            6                                                                                                           ]                          \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}left[\{{\textbackslash}begin\{array\}\{ccccc\}1\&a\_\{0\}\&a\_\{1\}\&a\_\{2\}\&a\_\{3\}{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}0\&0\&2\&a\_\{4\}\&a\_\{5\}{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}0\&0\&0\&1\&a\_\{6\}{\textbackslash}end\{array\}\}{\textbackslash}right]\}   Many properties of matrices may be easily deduced from their row echelon form, such as the rank and the kernel.},

  abstract = {The outcome of projectile impacts on spaced aluminium armour (i.e. Whipple shield) at hypervelocity is traditionally predicted by semi-analytical equations known as ballistic limit equations (BLEs). For spherical aluminium projectiles impacting aluminium Whipple shields, the state-of-the-art BLE has been found to correctly reproduce the perforation/non-perforation result of approximately 75\% of tests contained within a database with over 1100 entries. For such high-dimensional, complex problems, machine learning methods may be a superior approach over such semi-analytical/empirical methods. Towards this end an artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) have been developed to better classify the outcome of hypervelocity impact events on aluminium Whipple shields. The ANN was found to correctly reproduce the perforation/non-perforation result of over 93\% of the training exemplars, generalizing at 92.2\% when applied with an optimized architecture. The SVM was not able to reach comparable levels of generalization error as the ANN, peaking at 83\% after the removal of a small number of test exemplars which induced conflict within the SVM pattern recognition. Although providing a significant improvement in predictive accuracy over the conventional BLE, the performance of both the ANN and SVM were highly sensitive to the population density of the parameter space described by the training data. Within highly populated regions the qualitative trends of the machines are demonstrated to accurately identify patterns associated with projectile fragmentation and melting, while in sparsely populated regions the accuracy significantly decreases and the qualitative trends can become nonsensical. Further improvements in accuracy are limited by the inhomogeneous sampling of the parameter space defined by the current impact test database---a problem expected to be typical of any terminal ballistics problem in which the cost of performing experiments limits their scope to, for example, materials and geometries of interest, impact conditions expected during operation, and a limited range about the perforation threshold (i.e. ballistic limit). A combined novelty-detecting neural net and hetero-associate neural net have been applied to iteratively improve the performance of the ANN without requiring an inordinate number of additional tests. This process, referred to as bootstrapping, has been successfully demonstrated through the design of `optimized' Whipple shields for given impact conditions, hypervelocity impact testing of the designed shields, and re-training of the critic net to incorporate the results of the new impact tests.},

Change point detection is the identification of abrupt variation in the process behavior due to distributional or structural changes, whereas trend can be defined as estimation of gradual departure from past norms. We examine four different change point detection methods which, by virtue of current literature, appear to be the most widely used and the newest algorithms. They are Wild Binary Segmentation, E-Agglomerative algorithm for change point, Iterative Robust Detection method and Bayesian Analysis of Change Points. We measure the power and accuracy of these current methods using simulated data. We draw comparisons on the functionality and usefulness of each method. We also analyze the data in the presence of trend, using Mann--Kendall and Cox--Stuart methods together with the change point algorithms, in order to evaluate whether presence of trend affects change point or vice versa.},

The word "system" indicates that the equations are to be considered collectively, rather than individually. In mathematics, the theory of linear systems is the basis and a fundamental part of linear algebra, a subject which is used in most parts of modern mathematics. Computational algorithms for finding the solutions are an important part of numerical linear algebra, and play a prominent role in engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, and economics. A system of non-linear equations can often be approximated by a linear system (see linearization), a helpful technique when making a mathematical model or computer simulation of a relatively complex system. Very often, the coefficients of the equations are real or complex numbers and the solutions are searched in the same set of numbers, but the theory and the algorithms apply for coefficients and solutions in any field. For solutions in an integral domain like the ring of the integers, or in other algebraic structures, other theories have been developed, see Linear equation over a ring. Integer linear programming is a collection of methods for finding the "best" integer solution (when there are many). Gr{\"o}bner basis theory provides algorithms when coefficients and unknowns are polynomials. Also tropical geometry is an example of linear algebra in a more exotic structure.},

However, a comprehensive understanding of the impact, potential, and limitations of LLMs in AIOps remains in its infancy. To address this gap, we conducted a detailed survey of LLM4AIOps, focusing on how LLMs can optimize processes and improve outcomes in this domain. We analyzed 183 research articles published between January 2020 and December 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In RQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced LLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new data sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks, highlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across these tasks. RQ3 investigates the various LLM-based methods applied to address AIOps challenges. Finally, RQ4 reviews evaluation methodologies tailored to assess LLM-integrated AIOps approaches. Based on our findings, we discuss the state-of-the-art advancements and trends, identify gaps in existing research, and propose promising directions for future exploration.},
