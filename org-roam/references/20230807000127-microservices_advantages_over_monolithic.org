#+title: microservices advantages over monolithic
#+filetags:

* [[id:10682b04-b1f4-4200-a3a6-23a5d82c2795][Microservices]] have the following advantages over [[id:c5d789cf-3642-4b2a-a316-4edb622b2212][monolithic]] servers:
+ You can use different programming languages
+ The code base of a single server is smaller
+ They have an independent DevOps process to build and deploy activities
+ They can be scaled depending on their implementation
+ If one microservice fails, the rest will continue to work
+ They work well within containers
+ Increased isolation between elements leads to better security
+ They are suitable for projects involving the Internet of Things
+ They are in line with the [[id:df1d63a9-ab91-406c-bd99-e37b9db2a645][DevOps]] philosophy
+ They can be outsourced
+ They can be orchestrated after development
+ They are reusable
