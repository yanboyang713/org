Fork A Subdirectory Of Repo
* Introduction
Ever wanted to fork a subdirectory and not the whole Git/GitHub repository. Well I have, I recently had to fork a subdirectory of one of the repositories I wanted to work on without the need to fork the whole repository. In this post, I will show you how itâ€™s done.
* Clone the repo
#+begin_src console
git clone https://github.com/<someones-username>/<some-repo-you-want-to-fork>
cd some-repo-you-want-to-fork
#+end_src
* Create a branch using the git subtree command for the folder only
#+begin_src console
git subtree split --prefix=src -b dir-you-want-to-fork
git checkout dir-you-want-to-fork
#+end_src
