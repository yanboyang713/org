* What is AIOps?

AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) is a framework or practice that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate, optimize, and enhance IT operations. It focuses on using data-driven insights to monitor, detect, analyze, and resolve issues in complex IT environments.

Key components of AIOps:
+ Data Ingestion & Correlation: Collects logs, metrics, traces, and events from diverse sources.
+ Noise Reduction & Anomaly Detection: Filters irrelevant alerts, identifies anomalies in real time.
+ Root Cause Analysis (RCA): Uses ML to find the actual cause of incidents.
+ Automation & Remediation: Executes automated responses (e.g., scaling servers, restarting services).
+ Predictive Analysis: Forecasts potential failures or capacity issues before they occur.
