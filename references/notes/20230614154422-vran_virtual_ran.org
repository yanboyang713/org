* What is vRAN or Virtual RAN?
vRAN decouples the software from Hardware by virtualizing Network Functions. It uses virtualization technologies such as NFV or containers to deploy [[id:fea1dd7c-fe96-474d-af03-935b09b6ef4e][CU]] and [[id:50f525c2-9912-4a1a-972a-59626c963d51][DU]] over x86 server. (or virtual [[id:1329f1c2-a4a3-456b-b114-2220d3e990db][BBU]] on a server). This is like running Functions in software.

* Difference between vRAN and [[id:bb9686f3-3e83-466a-a3b5-2a2a20a361d5][C-RAN (Cloud RAN)]]
So there is no difference between vRAN and [[id:bb9686f3-3e83-466a-a3b5-2a2a20a361d5][C-RAN (Cloud RAN)]] except that traditionally [[id:bb9686f3-3e83-466a-a3b5-2a2a20a361d5][C-RAN (Cloud RAN)]] uses proprietary hardware while vRAN uses Network Functions on the server platform. vRAN is infact a type of [[id:bb9686f3-3e83-466a-a3b5-2a2a20a361d5][C-RAN (Cloud RAN)]].

Because of vRAN HW/SW decoupling flexibility, we can achieve scalability. This can cause a decrease in hardware costs and application agility as application can be upgraded easily or swapped altogether (which is not easier with traditional hardware).

However, vRAN puts servers to new limits because of the performance expectation. There has been quite an innovation on enhancing server platform to meet the performance needs of vRAN.
