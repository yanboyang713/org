#+title: Sampling Techniques

Sampling techniques are used to select a subset of data from a larger dataset. The goal is often to make inferences about the entire dataset or to reduce the size of the dataset for analysis. There are a couple of ways to work on Sampling.

* Random Sampling
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       42898d6a-8073-4283-b321-73bf6e92992f
:END:
Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.

* Stratified Sampling
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       69a78787-38e3-4764-9031-82c7b5fc2e6a
:END:
The population is divided into strata, and samples are taken from each stratum.

* Systematic Sampling
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8c30e230-d235-4186-80bd-784e3099a7a2
:END:
Every nth member of the population is selected.

* Cluster Sampling
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bbd1b73b-41ec-4ef1-9ae2-1efd4868b7bc
:END:
The population is divided into clusters, and entire clusters are randomly selected.

* Convenience Sampling
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b569452b-dceb-48a6-a53e-0f91c9cc5912
:END:
Samples are taken from a group that is conveniently accessible.
