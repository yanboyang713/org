#+title: OKD Bootstrap

OKD Bootstrap refers to the initial node in the OKD cluster installation process, playing a critical role in bootstrapping and setting up the cluster.
* Key Points to Remember
+ Temporary Role: The bootstrap node is not a permanent part of the cluster. It is used only during the initial setup phase.
+ Critical for Initial Setup: Without the bootstrap node, the cluster cannot be initialized. It is a critical component for setting up the control plane nodes.
+ Automation: The bootstrap process is largely automated, requiring minimal manual intervention, provided that the Ignition configuration files are correctly set up.
+ Resources: It is important to allocate sufficient resources to the bootstrap node, as it temporarily hosts critical services.
  Its resource requirements are similar to that of a master node because it performs many of the same tasks temporarily.
  + CPU: 4 vCPUs (virtual CPUs)
  + Memory: 16 GB RAM
  + Storage: 120 GB disk space
