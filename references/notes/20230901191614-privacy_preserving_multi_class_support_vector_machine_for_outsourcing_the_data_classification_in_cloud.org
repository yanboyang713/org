#+title: Privacy-Preserving Multi-Class Support Vector Machine for Outsourcing the Data Classification in Cloud
#+filetags:
In the cloud computing architecture-based IIoT, the authors proposed a multi-class support vector machine data classification method combined with homomorphic encryption, which could ensure the confidentiality of the data uploaded by the client and
the classification training set and parameters in data classification.
