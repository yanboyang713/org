#+title: Amazon API Gateway
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services.

Back-end services may include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any web application.
